# Larson's Game Engine

A **generic** game engine in pure Java. It provides a clean game loop
and the building blocks for any 2D or plan-view 3D game — sprite sheets,
level loading, a height axis you can build up to 512 blocks along,
cameras with multiple perspectives, scenes, input, a customizable menu
system, **online multiplayer** (host a server, friends join by IP + port,
Minecraft-style), a **shader system** (GLSL-first post-processing that runs as
real fragment shaders on the GPU backend and as a multithreaded CPU pipeline
everywhere else, each pass diffed against the other on a real driver) and
**two rendering backends**
(Java2D everywhere, OpenGL 3.3 where a driver answers — probed at startup, with
a real fallback) — without committing to a single genre.

The engine is built to be **a giant custom level loader**: you group levels
under a **game type** (a folder), and each **level** carries its own **format**
— side-scroller or 3D, each built in its own creative mode — plus only the
features it needs (zoom, framerate bounds, entity sizes, gravity, HUD, …). The
format and the toggles live on the level, so one game type can hold a mix of
levels of both kinds and they all play as one game; the game type just supplies
the default template new levels start from.
One engine drives many different games.

This engine is a **merge**: the minimal outline above, plus the feature
systems of its feature-rich sibling, **Side-Scroller-Game-Engine**, ported
over in a generic, data-driven form and wired to the same toggles:

- **Creative Mode** — a level editor for *painting objects into the world*
  (blocks, lights, mobs, items) with palette categories, drag-painting,
  erasing, pick-block, pan/zoom, play-testing, `Ctrl+Z` undo over **every**
  action it can take, and per-game-type level saving — in **two modes, one
  per level format** (side-scroller, 3D), each with its own palette, starter
  canvas and movement model. The 3D mode builds in **three dimensions**: stack
  columns against the face you point at, sculpt the ground with raise / lower /
  flatten / smooth brushes, lock a build height to cut a terrace, and roll a
  whole landscape from noise — all from a camera you turn around the world and
  tilt over it while you work.
  Works offline **and inside a multiplayer session**, where strokes replicate
  to every player. See [Creative mode](#creative-mode-paint-objects) and
  [The two level formats](#the-two-level-formats).
- **Blocks** — a data-driven [`BlockRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/BlockRegistry.java)
  (terrain, ores, decorations, light sources) with solidity, drops, and light
  emission; mining/placing in play mode with drops and particles.
- **Mobs** — a data-driven [`MobRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/MobRegistry.java)
  of species driven by the ported AI state machine (IDLE → WANDER → CHASE →
  ATTACK → FLEE → DEAD).
- **Items & inventory** — a data-driven [`ItemRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/ItemRegistry.java)
  with the original categories + rarity tiers, dropped items with bounce
  physics and pickup, and a fully interactive hotbar + grid inventory:
  click stacks to move/merge/swap them, drop items back into the world,
  eat food — all server-authoritative online.
- **Combat** — a full melee move set carried by whatever you are *holding*:
  swing, **parry**, **lunge**, **dash**, and a held **shield-ready** guard,
  each with its own wind-up → strike → recovery on that weapon's timings, its
  own animation state, and its own sound states. Mobs fight with the same
  machine and can carry real weapons; a held object can bring its own
  sprite sheets for the fighter using it (idle is always the fallback), so
  every item can animate its own combat. Plus the knockback, mob loot,
  health and respawn it always had. See
  [Melee combat](#melee-combat-swing-parry-lunge-dash-shield).
- **Projectiles & ranged weapons** — a data-driven
  [`ProjectileRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/ProjectileRegistry.java)
  (arrows, rocks, throwing knives, magic bolts, exploding fireballs): bows
  consume arrows, throwables throw themselves, physical shots arc under
  gravity and land as recoverable drops, magic glows through the lighting
  shader pass. Simulated by the same `World` everywhere, so it all works
  online (server-side ammo, snapshot replication, impact FX broadcasts).
- **First and third person** — `[F5]` cycles the viewpoint the way every 3D
  game does: plan view, first person, third person behind, third person in
  front. The blocks a 3D level is already built out of are
  drawn as solid cubes seen from *inside* the world through a real perspective
  camera ([`EyeCamera`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/EyeCamera.java)
  + [`SolidPainter`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/SolidPainter.java))
  — mouse-look, a crosshair that mines and places what it is pointed at, face
  shading, distance fog, and every mob, drop and player billboarded out of the
  sprites the flat view already draws them with. Nothing about the level
  changes; a side-scroller, which has no third axis to stand an eye in, keeps
  its one view. See
  [First and third person](#first-and-third-person-the-f5-view).
- **Lighting** — day/night cycle and point lights, implemented as a
  [`LightingPass`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/shader/LightingPass.java)
  in the GLSL-first shader chain, so it composes with every other effect.
- **Sound** — every action state in the game is a *sound key* you can
  supply: the player swimming, sprinting, landing and casting an ultimate;
  each block placed, broken, mined and walked on; each mob spawning,
  attacking and dying; each shot fired, in flight and landing; per-level
  music, ambience, doors, cutscenes and mini-game events. Audio comes from a
  **drop-in sound pack** of WAVs and MP3s beside the jar, and creative mode's
  **sound editor** lists every one of them. Every sound plays at a slightly
  different pitch each time, Minecraft-style, so repeats never sound
  mechanical. See [Sound](#sound-every-action-state).
- **Parallax backgrounds and particles** — procedural, keeping the engine
  asset-free and JDK-only; the same is true of sound, which falls back to
  synthesized effects and, beyond those, to silence.
- **Auto Battler** — a complete standalone game mode, its own picture button in
  the corner of the launch screen: an
  online auto-battler for **2-10 players** in the style of Dota Auto Chess /
  Teamfight Tactics, played on an **isometric** board with synergies, rounds,
  items, and units collected over the game — shops, a shared unit pool,
  3-copies-combine star-ups, an economy with interest and streaks, PvE creep
  rounds that drop item components, an **elemental damage layer**
  (attack elements, resistances, and weaknesses whose impact grows round
  over round), **synergy categories** with filterable UI, and deterministic
  server-simulated battles replicated to every client — presented with
  **replicated animation states**, per-unit **cartoony idle animations**,
  **animated projectiles**, melee/cast/death effects, a per-unit
  **damage meter** split by damage type, **board scouting** (click any
  player's name), **skinnable textures** (sprite-sheet overrides for
  units, items, projectiles, and the board), and **personal board
  customization** (color schemes, background images, decorative props). See
  [Auto Battler](#auto-battler-online-2-10-players).
- **Council of Six** — a second complete standalone game mode, its own picture
  button on the launch screen: an online **deckbuilding board game for 2-6 players**
  in the spirit of Dune Imperium and Inis, themed around the crew itself —
  play cards to place agents on board locations, buy from a shared market
  row, deploy troops for territory majorities, and win round-end conflicts,
  with six leader passives (Larson, Matt, Dustin, Kris, Bella, Eric), bots
  to fill seats, turn timers, and **shader-lit particle effects** (every
  table event bursts through the mode's bloom pass). Deliberately simpler
  than Magic. See [Council of Six](#council-of-six-deckbuilding-board-game-2-6-online).
- **Evolution** — a third complete standalone game mode, its own picture button
  on the launch screen: an **artificial life simulator** where organisms are strands of
  red/green/blue DNA that replicate imperfectly, express traits and shapes from
  hard-coded genetic rules, and are pruned by hunger, crowding, temperature and
  each other. You seed one square cell, feed the dish, and earn shop credit for
  every strand and colony combination that has never existed before, recorded in
  a reference book that ships empty on purpose. Discoveries are kept in two tiers, so the game can be **fully reset**
  whenever you like while your history of every organism ever found is kept
  forever. See [Evolution](#evolution-artificial-life-simulator).
- **Field Guide** — a fourth complete standalone game mode, its own picture
  button on the launch screen: an **animal-watching game for 1-8 players
  online**, walked in first person across an endless low-poly world of
  **twenty biomes**. Hold still and things come closer; spot one and **click
  it, and it lights up for everyone else** for a few seconds. There are
  **1323 species** to catalog, each with a generated Minecraft-style skin and
  a boxy model that a Blockbench `.bbmodel` drops straight in for. Trees grow
  through five stages in real hours — while you are away too — and
  cross-pollinate into hybrid species that were not in the world when you
  started; you fish, forage, cook, cultivate seed, set out feeders for the
  diets you are missing, tame a few, and build a house or a tree house out of
  what you found. **The sun follows your own clock** — and when it goes down you
  build a campfire, carry a lantern or light a torch, all of them **lit on the
  GPU**, per fragment, along with the burning ribcage of whatever is walking
  toward you out of the treeline.
  See [Field Guide](#field-guide-animal-watching-1-8-online).
- **Custom key binds** — every action in the engine, from *jump* to the
  creative editor's *undo* to the auto battler's *reroll*, is rebindable to
  **any key or any mouse button** (side buttons included, with
  `Ctrl`/`Shift`/`Alt` combinations) from a **Controls (Key Binds)** menu that
  is on every game type's main menu, the pause menus and the editor — and on
  each mini game's own lobby, showing that game's keys rather than the
  engine's. Two slots per action, conflicts flagged, one readable
  `config/keybinds.json` for the whole engine. See
  [Custom key binds](#custom-key-binds-rebind-anything).
- **Skins (texture overrides)** — drop PNG sprite sheets in
  `resources/skins/` and assign them in the lobby's **Customize Skins** menu:
  frame pixel width/height + frame count + a 0-120 fps playback rate, per
  texture (units get one per animation state). Saved to your game files and
  applied live. See [Skins](#skins-texture-overrides).
- **Texture packs** — or skip the menus entirely: a `textures/` folder next
  to the jar, with a subfolder per palette category and files named after the
  objects (`blocks/dirt.png`, `mobs/slime.png`), reskins the game on sight.
  A generated key list names every object for you, one universal frame
  size/count/fps covers the whole pack, and anything you don't supply keeps
  its built-in icon. Blocks get a **second pool for the plan-view
  perspectives** — `blocks_top/` and `blocks_side/` — because a side-scroller
  and a 3D level look at different faces of the same block. See
  [Texture packs](#texture-packs-drop-in-art).
- **Stacked blocks (3D)** — a 3D level builds in **two
  layers**, and the stack is its geometry: bare ground is a hole, one layer
  is a pathway, two is a barrier. Blocks stack by themselves — place one on a
  cell that already has a block and it goes on top — and a stacked block is
  drawn standing off its own floor tile, **casting a shadow** in the direction
  the level's sun is set to, so height is something you can see rather than a
  colour you have to learn. It sorts against the players, mobs and scenery
  around it, so you pass behind the wall to your north and in front of the one
  to your south. See
  [Stacked blocks](#stacked-blocks-the-plan-views-geometry).
- **Share with friends** — launching from IntelliJ auto-builds a `share/`
  folder with a runnable jar, double-click launch scripts, online-play
  instructions (including your LAN address), and empty texture and sound
  packs to fill. See [Sharing the game](#sharing-the-game--how-joining-works).
- **Giant levels (up to 65536×65536)** — levels past 1024×1024 switch to
  sparse **chunked storage**
  ([`ChunkedTiles`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/ChunkedTiles.java)):
  only the chunks the camera/simulation actually touch are loaded, generated
  worlds build their chunks **lazily and deterministically** on first sight
  ([`ChunkGenerator`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/ChunkGenerator.java)),
  pristine chunks evict under memory pressure and regenerate identically, and
  saves keep only the edited chunks (RLE-compressed). The creative editor's
  **"override map size"** button unlocks its size sliders up to the full
  65536.
- **Full AABB block collisions** — movement resolves axis-separated sweeps
  against every block face: walls stop sideways movement, ceilings stop
  jumps, floors stop falls — for players *and* mobs, via shared helpers in
  [`PlayerPhysics`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/PlayerPhysics.java).
- **Advanced mob navigation** — mobs hop low walls and gaps while chasing,
  swim (buoyancy + surfacing) in liquids, refuse to walk into lava/acid/
  spikes, and **dodge incoming projectiles** aimed their way.
- **Block durability & tools** — every block has a hardness (seconds of
  hold-to-mine, with a growing crack overlay); pickaxes/axes/shovels in
  wood/stone/iron/diamond tiers break their matching block families faster.
- **Crafting & alchemy stations** — place a crafting table or alchemy
  station, stand next to it and press **E**: a recipe panel
  ([`CraftingPanel`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/ui/CraftingPanel.java))
  combines 1-3 ingredient stacks into new items
  ([`RecipeRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/crafting/RecipeRegistry.java)) —
  logs → planks → sticks → tools/weapons, ore smelting, potion brewing —
  so most of the catalog is reachable from resources found in the world.
- **Stamina & mana** — sprinting (Shift) and jumping spend stamina, magic
  staves cost mana, both regenerate and render as HUD bars.
- **Programmable stat rules** — the engine tracks per-run stats (blocks
  mined/placed, items picked up, distance traveled, jumps, kills, crafts…)
  in [`PlayerStats`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/PlayerStats.java);
  map makers script triggers over them
  ([`StatRule`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/StatRule.java), saved
  with the level): *"mined 50 blocks → receive a potion"*, *"every 1000 px
  travelled → receive bread"*, *"holding ≥ 10 stone → consume 10 stone,
  receive an ingot"* — one-shot or repeating, optionally charted as live HUD
  progress bars.
- **Triggerable cutscenes** — map makers script cinematic sequences in the
  creative editor ([`Cutscene`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/Cutscene.java)):
  a trigger (walk into a zone, press **E** at a marker, or level start), a
  cast of sprite-sheet **actors with named animation states** (per-state
  sheet, frame size/count, 0-120 fps, loop or one-shot), and an ordered step
  script — show / say / move / switch animation state / wait / camera pan /
  hide. Cutscenes save with the level and play in play-test and play with
  letterbox bars, dialogue captions, and Enter/Esc skipping. See
  [Cutscenes](#cutscenes-triggerable-scripted-scenes).
- **Coloured rarity lighting** — uncommon+ items glow with a pulsing halo in
  their rarity tier's colour, and after dark they carry a real point light of
  that colour through the lighting pass.
- **Custom content ("+" entries)** — every creative palette category leads
  with a **+** icon that opens a fully-customizable property form
  (Hytale-style) for new blocks, liquids, lights, mobs, items, and
  decorations; creations persist per game type
  ([`CustomContentStore`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/config/CustomContentStore.java))
  and re-register on load so saved levels keep working. A new block is always
  asked whether it has a **top texture, a side texture, or both**, and told
  the exact files to draw for them.
- **Brush shapes** — square/circle/diamond/line/spray brushes up to 12 tiles
  across paint or erase many blocks per stroke
  ([`Brush`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/Brush.java)).
- **Surface decor** — per-face block details (tall grass tufts, hanging
  moss, twigs, icicles, cobwebs…) attach to a block's up/down/left/right
  face with toggles for *open/closed-face* visibility and
  *background/foreground* layering
  ([`SurfaceDecor`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/SurfaceDecor.java)).

Everything above **works online**: the authoritative server simulates the
world (mobs, items, drops, day/night), snapshots replicate entities, and
block edits broadcast to every client — including players who join later.
Every feature is a **toggle** carried by each level (game types just group
levels into a folder), exactly like the original engine's features.

## Design goals

This engine was built against six explicit requirements:

| # | Requirement | How it's addressed |
|---|-------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **120 FPS** | A fixed-timestep [`GameLoop`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/core/GameLoop.java) renders with a configurable cap (default **120**). The limiter schedules frames on an absolute timeline and uses a hybrid coarse-sleep / fine-park wait, so the cap is hit precisely without pegging a CPU. |
| 2 | **Multiple 2D perspectives** | Two **distinct level formats** ([`LevelFormat`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/LevelFormat.java)) — side-scroller and 3D — each with its own creative mode, movement model and **number of block layers**, both loading and playing through the same code. [`Camera`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/Camera.java) + [`Perspective`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/Perspective.java) supply the projections (`SIDE_SCROLL`, `THREE_D`). The 3D camera turns around the player in **eight compass points** and **tilts freely** from 0° to 90° over the floor, which is what folded the old separate "top-down" and "isometric" formats into one: they were the same world seen from two places to stand — and 0°, flat on the floor, is a third: the level cut open along the line you are looking down, which reads as a side-scroller made out of a 3D level. A level can restrict all of it ([`CameraLock`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/CameraLock.java)): exact headings, a tilt range or a single angle, and which stops of the F5 cycle are reachable. A level's format is fixed for its lifetime — the two are different worlds, not two views of one — and a door into a level of the other format is how a game changes perspective. What the player *can* switch mid-play is where they stand to look: `[F5]` cycles plan view / first person / third person, drawn from inside the level by [`EyeCamera`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/EyeCamera.java) + [`SolidPainter`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/SolidPainter.java) wherever there is a height axis to stand an eye in. See [First and third person](#first-and-third-person-the-f5-view). |
| 3 | **Online play** | ✅ Implemented — see [Online play](#online-play). An authoritative [`GameServer`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/net/GameServer.java) ticks the same deterministic [`PlayerPhysics`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/PlayerPhysics.java) clients predict with; host in-game or run a headless dedicated server; friends join by IP + port like Minecraft Java edition. |
| 4 | **Out of the box on any Java machine** | The engine uses **only the JDK** (Java2D / AWT / Swing / sockets). No third-party runtime dependencies — JSON parsing, networking, and shader execution are all in-engine. The optional GL backend lives in a separate Gradle project and a separate jar, so this stays true of the one a player double-clicks — checked on every build by `:verifyNoRuntimeDependencies`, which fails the `jar` task if anything external reaches the runtime classpath. |
| 5 | **Shader support** | ✅ Implemented — see [Shaders](#shaders). Every [`ShaderPass`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/shader/ShaderPass.java) is defined **GLSL-first** (real GPU fragment-shader source, exportable as `.frag` files) beside a multithreaded CPU implementation, and every pass is compiled on a real driver and diffed against its CPU twin (`ShaderCompileTest`, `ShaderParityTest`: five passes at 0.00 mean channel error out of 255, worst 3.58). **Both sides now execute**: the GL backend compiles each pass's `glsl()` once and runs the chain as a framebuffer ping-pong over the scene texture, and the Java2D backend runs the CPU implementation in parallel row stripes. `GlShaderChainTest` renders every pass both ways through the shipping chain and reproduces those same per-pass errors — which is what says the backend is right, since the shaders were measured before it existed. |
| ★ | **Rendering backend** | Two, chosen at startup by a real probe. Java2D is the floor and runs anywhere; the OpenGL 3.3 backend is used when a driver gives a context, and the engine falls back to Java2D with a stated reason when it does not. `-Dlarsons.render.backend=auto\|java2d\|gl` overrides, and every frame report names the backend and the driver. See [Rendering backends](#rendering-backends-java2d-and-opengl). |
| 6 | **Editing outline of game essentials** | Working, minimal implementations of sprite sheets, level loading, and menu customization, wired together by the demo scenes. |
| ★ | **Feature toggles + game types** | Clickable toggles enable/disable features. Toggles are stored **per level** ([`Level.settings`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/Level.java)) so one game type can group diverse levels; the game type ([`GameProfile`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/config/GameProfile.java) under `resources/gametypes/`) is just the folder, with its own feature values pinned to the defaults so there is exactly one place — the level — where a feature is decided. **Level Select** picks an individual level and either plays it or edits its settings. |

---

## Requirements

- **Java 21+** (the only requirement to run).
- Gradle is **optional** — a wrapper is included (`./gradlew`), but you can also
  build with plain `javac`/`java` (see below).

## Running it

### With Gradle (recommended)

```bash
./gradlew run          # launch the demo (menu -> playable level)
./gradlew test         # run the headless smoke tests
./gradlew jar          # build build/libs/Larsons-Game-Engine-0.1.0.jar
java -jar build/libs/Larsons-Game-Engine-0.1.0.jar

# headless dedicated multiplayer server (see "Online play"):
./gradlew runServer --args="--port 7777 --level levels/sample_level.json"
```

The jar above has **no external dependencies** — that is checked on every build
rather than intended (`:verifyNoRuntimeDependencies` fails the `jar` task if
anything lands on the runtime classpath), so Java 21 really is the only
requirement.

### Rendering backends (Java2D and OpenGL)

The engine has two renderers and picks one at startup. **Java2D is the floor:**
it needs nothing but a JRE, and it is what a machine with no driver, a headless
CI agent, or anyone who passes `-Dlarsons.render.backend=java2d` gets. The
OpenGL 3.3 backend is used when a driver actually hands over a context.

The OpenGL renderer lives in its own Gradle project, `:gl`, so the plain jar
stays JDK-only. It is built and distributed separately:

```bash
./gradlew :gl:build    # compile and test the GL backend
./gradlew :gl:glDist   # gl/build/libs/larsons-engine-gl.jar — engine + GL + LWJGL
./gradlew :gl:runGl    # run the game on it, with the profiler armed
```

**Comparing the two renderers on your own machine** is two tasks that take no
arguments — or, in IntelliJ, two entries in the run dropdown, **Profile — GL
backend** and **Profile — Java2D backend**:

```bash
./gradlew :gl:profileGl        # → profile-gl.txt
./gradlew :gl:profileJava2d    # → profile-java2d.txt
```

Each arms the profiler without starting it: load a level, press **F3** there,
play normally for 30 seconds, and it writes its report and stops. Run both in
the same level doing the same things, then diff the two files. Both launch from
the same project with the same classpath so the renderer is the only difference
between them, and each report names its own backend and driver at the head.

Both jars contain the same engine. The GL one also contains the backend and a
`META-INF/services` entry naming it, and that entry is the whole of the coupling
— the core discovers backends with `ServiceLoader` and does not know this one
exists. So `java -jar Larsons-Game-Engine-0.1.0.jar` finds nothing and runs
Java2D, and the GL distribution finds one and probes it.

**Choosing, at the command line:**

```bash
-Dlarsons.render.backend=auto     # default: GL if a driver answers, else Java2D
-Dlarsons.render.backend=java2d   # Java2D, without probing for anything
-Dlarsons.render.backend=gl       # GL only; still runs on Java2D if it cannot start,
                                  #   and says on stderr that the flag was not honoured
-Dlarsons.render.gl.version=4.1   # ask for a different core profile (debugging)
-Dlarsons.render.vsync=off        # present as fast as frames are made (benchmarking)
-Dlarsons.render.gl.drawablelock=off   # macOS: draw without the resize lock (see below)
-Dlarsons.render.chooser=always   # ask which renderer to use, even if it was answered
-Dlarsons.render.chooser=never    # never ask (scripted runs)
-Dlarsons.run.seconds=30          # quit after 30 s — how a launch is checked unattended
```

**And for a player who double-clicks the jar, it is a question rather than a
flag.** A manifest cannot carry JVM arguments, so the flag above is unreachable
for exactly the person most likely to need it. The GL distribution therefore
asks once, on first launch, which renderer to use, and writes the answer to
`config/render.json` beside the key binds — after that it starts without a word.
Delete that file, or launch with `-Dlarsons.render.chooser=always`, to change
your mind. An explicit `-Dlarsons.render.backend` always wins over both, and the
plain jar never asks at all, because it has one renderer and a menu with one item
on it is worse than no menu.

The engine prints one line at startup saying which backend it is on and why, and
**every frame profile carries the same two facts at its head** — the backend and
the GL vendor/renderer/version string. A profile that does not say what drew it
cannot be acted on.

**Which window you get follows from which backend.** Java2D draws into the AWT
`JFrame` the engine has always opened; the GL backend arrives with a GLFW window
of its own, and then no `JFrame` is created at all. They are never both alive.
Input is identical either way — GLFW events are translated into the same
`InputManager` the AWT canvas feeds, so key binds saved under one backend work
under the other.

**Resizing that window is not free on macOS, and the arrangement is worth
knowing about.** The GL window is pumped on the thread that started the engine
and drawn on the game loop's thread, and those two share one drawable: AppKit
reallocates it during a live resize while the render thread is still writing
into it, which used to terminate the process. Each frame now holds the
platform's `CGLLockContext` from the first draw call to the buffer swap, so a
resize waits for the frame in flight rather than landing in the middle of it.
The trade is that dragging an edge can wait up to one frame per mouse move;
`-Dlarsons.render.gl.drawablelock=off` restores the old behaviour for anyone
who wants to tell the difference. Everywhere other than macOS this costs
nothing and is never reached.

**A macOS GL launch also runs AWT headless, and that is deliberate.** AWT and
GLFW both want to run an `NSApplication` on the process's first thread, and
AWT's loop is one that never returns — so once it starts, the engine's event
pump enters `glfwPollEvents` and never comes back out. The game still plays,
because the platform keeps delivering events to the window whoever is pumping;
what stops is the *loop*, which means the close button sets a flag nobody reads
and the game cannot be quit from its own window. Setting `java.awt.headless=true`
before AWT initialises is LWJGL's documented answer and is what the launcher
does, on macOS, when a GPU backend is on the classpath. Everything the engine
uses AWT for — every sprite is a `BufferedImage`, terrain bakes through
`Graphics2D`, the glyph atlas rasterises real fonts — works headless; the one
thing that does not is opening a window, which on this path is exactly what AWT
must not do. **The visible consequence** is that the sprite-sheet import dialogs
in the creative, skin and board editors fall back to typing the path, which they
have always been able to do, and say so. `-Djava.awt.headless=false` overrides
it, and no other platform or backend is affected.

The GL backend draws every scene in the golden catalogue to within **2.59/255**
of the Java2D renderer and collapses the catalogue's 3,356 drawing operations
into **68** draw calls.

**Post-processing runs on the GPU there too.** The scene lands in a texture
rather than the back buffer, and the shader chain is a framebuffer ping-pong
over it — no readback, no upload, one fullscreen triangle per pass. That
includes `LightingPass`, which is day/night and every torch in the world rather
than a cosmetic filter, so a GL build is no longer a build without lighting.
Each pass is timed with GPU timer queries rather than by the clock on the
submitting thread, because a draw call returns before the work it queued has
started and the profile has to say what the frame really cost.

**Measured on real hardware** (M1 MacBook Air, `PlayScene` at 1280×720 on a 2×
panel, four runs across two builds):

| | Java2D | GL |
|---|---:|---:|
| **scene** | 9.77 / 9.42 ms | **3.92 / 3.65 ms** |
| work per frame (16.67 ms budget) | 16.83 / 12.13 ms | **6.94 / 6.67 ms** |
| headroom | −1.0% / +27.2% | **+58.3% / +60.0%** |
| sustainable FPS | 59 / 82 | **144 / 150** |

The scene stage — the one a GPU renderer exists to move — fell **61%**, and the
machine went from missing its frame budget to holding it with more than half to
spare. Full table, method and caveats in [`RENDER_PLAN.md`](RENDER_PLAN.md)
(B10).

### With just the JDK (no Gradle, no downloads)

```bash
# compile
find src/main/java -name '*.java' > sources.txt
javac -d out @sources.txt

# run (resources dir on the classpath so levels load)
java -cp "out:src/main/resources" com.larsons.engine.core.Main
```

On launch you'll choose or create a **game type** before playing — see
[Game types & feature toggles](#game-types--feature-toggles).

### Demo controls

Everything below is the **default** binding. Every one of them can be moved
onto any key or any mouse button from *Controls (Key Binds)*, which is on every
game type's main menu, the in-game pause menu, and each mini game's own lobby —
see [Custom key binds](#custom-key-binds-rebind-anything).

- **Menus / forms:** arrow keys to move, **Left/Right** to adjust a value,
  **Enter** to activate, or use the mouse (hover + click the toggles/steppers).
  In the game-type editor, just type to set the name.
- **Level:** `WASD` / arrows to move, **Space** to jump, **+ / -** to zoom
  (if enabled), **Esc** to open the pause menu. **Space is the only jump key** — `W`/`Up` are *directions*:
  they stroke upward while swimming, climb while flying, and walk north in a
  3D level, so holding one no longer bounces you off the
  ground. Jumping itself works in **both formats**: gravity in
  side-scroll, and a **hop along the elevation axis** in 3D
  (you rise over your own shadow and land back down) — same key, same double
  jump, same stamina cost. Which of these are available depends on the active
  game type and the character you picked.
- **World interaction** (per the game type's toggles): **left-click** fires
  the held ranged weapon / throwable, else mines the aimed block, else swings
  at mobs; **right-click** places the selected hotbar block; **1-5** / mouse
  wheel select the hotbar slot; **Q** drops one of the selected item;
  **F** eats the selected food (a server request online); **R** fires your
  character's **ultimate ability** once its meter is full; **I** opens the
  inventory — click a stack to pick it up, click another slot to place/merge/
  swap it, click outside the panel to drop it into the world.
- **Melee moves** (whatever you are holding decides how they feel — see
  [Melee combat](#melee-combat-swing-parry-lunge-dash-shield)): **left-click**
  swings, **V** parries (catches a blow outright and turns shots around),
  **X** lunges, **Z** dashes, and **holding C** raises the guard.
- **Camera:** **`,` / `.`** turn the camera (a plan view snaps between eight
  compass points; a solid view turns freely). **F5** cycles the viewpoint —
  plan view, first person, third person, third person from the front — in any
  level with a height axis; move the mouse to look, and **Home / End** tilt if
  you would rather not. In first and third person the crosshair in the middle
  of the screen is what you are aiming at, not the pointer. See
  [First and third person](#first-and-third-person-the-f5-view).
- **Starting a level:** if its creator put more than one character on the
  level's roster, a **character picker** opens first — arrow keys or the
  mouse to choose, Enter to drop in (see
  [Characters, ultimates & directional animation](#characters-ultimates--directional-animation)).
- **Creative mode:** see [Creative mode](#creative-mode-paint-objects).
- **Multiplayer:** from the main menu, *Multiplayer (Host / Join)* — host a
  server on a port, or type a `host[:port]` address and join (see
  [Online play](#online-play)).
- **Profiling:** **F3** toggles the frame-cost readout in any scene, **F4**
  writes a report to disk (see
  [Frame profiler](#frame-profiler-where-the-time-actually-goes)).

### The game loop

`GameLoop` separates **update** from **render**:

- **Update** runs at a fixed `updateRate` (default 120 Hz). Each step gets the
  same `dt = 1/updateRate`, so simulation is deterministic and frame-rate
  independent. Catch-up updates per frame are capped to avoid a "spiral of
  death" after a hitch.
- **Render** runs up to `targetFps` (default 120) and receives an interpolation
  `alpha` — how far past the last completed step real time has got — which the
  play scene and the creative play-test **use** to draw between two steps rather
  than on top of the latest one.

**That last word is load-bearing, and it was not true for most of the engine's
life.** A frame never contains a whole number of fixed steps: the step is 8.33 ms
and a 60 Hz refresh is 16.67 ms, so a frame nominally owes two but the remainder
in the accumulator wanders and some frames owe one or three. Drawing the last
completed step whole therefore scrolled the world by 1.8, 3.7 or 5.5 px on
successive frames where 3.7 was due — the shimmer players reported as "the blocks
are shaking", most visibly in a side-scroller, which is the format that pans
continuously along one axis for seconds at a time. On a 144 Hz display, where a
120 Hz simulation simply cannot keep up, better than one frame in four was a
duplicate of the one before it.
[`StepInterpolation`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/StepInterpolation.java)
holds the argument and the numbers; the drawn position is now provably a linear
function of real time, one step behind it, whatever number of steps a frame ran.
Nothing about the simulation changes — the blend reads two positions and returns a
third for drawing, so a headless server calls none of it and two machines still
agree.

The accumulator arithmetic itself lives in
[`FrameCadence`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/core/FrameCadence.java), apart
from the loop's threading, so the decision that produces `alpha` can be measured
without a clock.

This structure is what online play (requirement #3) is built on: the server
ticks the same fixed-step simulation clients predict with, so both sides agree
on results. The frame limiter schedules frames on an absolute timeline (each
deadline advances by exactly one frame period, so timing error can't
accumulate) and waits with a hybrid strategy — coarse `sleep` until ~2 ms
before the deadline, then short `parkNanos` slices — because a bare
`Thread.sleep` oversleeps by a scheduler quantum, which at 120 FPS (8.3 ms
frames) costs real frames.

### The two level formats

A level belongs to one of two **formats**
([`LevelFormat`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/LevelFormat.java)) — and
the format, not the game type, is what decides how it is built and how it
plays:

| Format | Projection | Up is | Movement | Palette |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Side-Scroller** | the vertical plane | up the screen | gravity: run, jump, swim, fall | everything except paths/walls |
| **3D** | the floor, turned and tilted | out of the screen | walks the plane on both axes | everything, **plus paths & walls** |

**There were three of these, and two of them were the same world.** "Top-down"
and "isometric" differed in exactly one thing: where the camera stood over the
floor. They shared their gravity axis, their two-layer geometry, their movement
model, their palette and their file format, and picking between them at the
moment of *creating* a level asked a creator to commit — permanently, before
building anything — to a camera angle. They are now one format whose camera the
player moves while playing: **`,` / `.` turn it around the eight compass points
and `Home` / `End` raise and lower it freely** between 0° and 90° over the
floor. Both are remembered per level: a level opens at the heading *and* the
tilt it was saved from, so a maze laid out to be read from directly above opens
from directly above. Neither is a constraint on the player, and neither goes
over the wire.

**0° is a view of its own: the level cut open.** Bring the camera all the way
down and the floor's depth axis multiplies by zero — the whole plane collapses
onto one screen row, height is drawn at full length, and what is left is a
**side elevation of the slice the player is standing in**. Everything in front
of them is cut away (it would otherwise be drawn over them, because at that
angle every depth lands in the same band of screen), and the cut shows its own
cross-section: the interior faces a slice exposes are drawn rather than
suppressed as hidden. What you see is the line you are looking down and
everything behind it, which reads as a side-scroller made out of a 3D level.
Turn the camera to check another axis, or press `[F5]` to walk it in first or
third person.

The band just above the floor has nothing to recommend it — too foreshortened
to read, not yet cut — so the tilt keys **drop through it** (`Camera.SLICE_DETENT`)
and one press off the floor comes back out the other side. `Camera.setPitch`
has no detent, because a level's own camera rules and a test are not a held key.

**The tilt is applied to the height axis at the moment it is used, not at the
moment a body was followed.** How far a block of height carries something up the
screen is `Camera.liftScale()`, which is the tilt's own cosine — so a lift
stored in *pixels* when the camera followed the player is a lift measured
against an angle the camera may since have left. Holding `Home` while standing
on a tower made the world jump for exactly that reason, and further the higher
you stood. `Camera.elevation()` is derived from a height in world units instead,
and cannot go stale.

**The camera follows the player's height with slack.** Keyed rigidly to the
body it rises the instant the body does, so the player hangs motionless in the
middle of the screen and the whole world drops away and comes back — every hop,
and every step up a staircase — which reads as the ground moving rather than as
the character jumping. So a played level's camera ignores anything within
`Camera.FOLLOW_SLACK_BLOCKS` of where it is keyed (a hop's whole arc, and the
first steps of a climb) and glides over the rest, which is what still keeps
somebody climbing a tower on their own screen. A height change no body could
have made in one step — a door, a respawn, a teleport — is placed rather than
eased into, and a cutscene's camera stays rigid
(`Camera.HeightFollow`).

Three things stop working at 0° if nothing is done about them, and the engine
does something about each:

| What breaks | Why | What the engine does |
|---|---|---|
| Depth sorting | every cell shares one screen row, so a painter sorting on rows has nothing to sort by | sorts on `Camera.depthOf` — distance along the view axis, which the screen row was only ever a foreshortened copy of |
| The inverse projection | a screen point is a whole line of world | `inversePlanar` drops the depth it cannot recover; `screenToWorld` puts it back at the focus's own depth, so a click lands on the slice you are looking at |
| The near half drawing over the far half | nothing is behind anything on screen any more | `TerrainPainter.sliceCut` cuts the world at the focus, for terrain and actors alike, and `TerrainCache` stands aside because there is no floor left to bake |

### Camera locks: where a level may be looked at from

The freedom above is right for a sandbox and wrong for a great many levels
somebody has actually composed. A side-on puzzle laid out to be read as a cut
through the world is nonsense from overhead; a room built to be entered from
the south shows a player the back of every wall if they turn round; a jump
measured by eye at one tilt is a different jump at another.

So a level can say where its camera may stand
([`CameraLock`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/CameraLock.java)),
in *Level Select → Edit Settings* (and on the *New Level* screen). Each axis is
restricted on its own and each defaults to unrestricted, so a level that never
opens the section behaves exactly as it did before locks existed:

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Facing North … North-West** | Any subset of the eight compass points. The rotate keys step *over* what is not allowed; one heading left is a fixed camera. The last one cannot be unticked — a camera has to point somewhere. |
| **Lowest / highest camera tilt** | The tilt's range in degrees. Equal ends pin it to one angle: `0/0` is a level that is always the cut view, `90/90` one that is always overhead. |
| **Tilt snaps to steps of** | Turns the range into a list of *exact* angles — `0–90` by `15` is seven angles and nothing between them. The grid starts at the low end, so the lowest angle you allowed is one a player can actually rest at. |
| **View: First person / Third person / Third person, front** | Which stops the `[F5]` cycle may reach. The plan view is always available — it is what every level is authored through and what the others fall back to — so switching all three off simply means `[F5]` stays put. |
| *Unlock the camera* | Puts every axis back to unrestricted. |

A lock is obeyed by **every** way of placing the camera, not only by the keys a
player presses: `turn` and `tilt` for the player, and `setYaw`/`setPitch` for a
level opening at its authored angle — which is snapped to the nearest allowed
heading and clamped into the allowed tilt rather than contradicting the lock.
It is written into the level file as names rather than bitmasks
(`"camera": {"headings": ["n","s"], "maxPitch": 0}`) and omitted entirely when
it restricts nothing.

**The creative editor is not under the lock**, deliberately: a lock says where
a level is meant to be *played* from, and building it needs to see the far side
of every wall. Tilt and turn to the locked angle yourself when you want to
check it. A camera brought most of the way down is the oblique three-quarter view
that used to be called isometric; a camera at the top of its travel is the
straight-down view that used to be called top-down. Levels saved under either
old name load as 3D.

Each format has its **own creative mode** — the main menu's *Creative Mode*
entry picks which one to open, the *New Level* screen then names and sizes the
level being built, and the editor paints, play-tests and
generates for that format. Playing is the opposite: a level simply loads in the
format it was built in, so a game type can hold side-scrolling caves and a 3D
overworld at once, and a **door between the two formats swaps the camera and
the movement model mid-play** with no reload.

The format is saved in the level file (`"format": "3d"`), so
[`LevelStore`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/LevelStore.java) can list
a game type's levels by format without loading them; levels written before
formats existed load as side-scrollers, and ones written as `top_down` or
`isometric` load as 3D.

**What actually differs.** Only the *path* and *wall* block families are
format-specific — they read as plan-view geometry, so they appear in the 3D
palette only (a side-scrolling level that already contains them still renders
and collides with them). Everything else — blocks, liquids, lights, mobs,
items, decorations, block details, doors, cutscenes, vehicles, mini games — is
offered in both and behaves in both:

- **Gravity** is a side-scroller property. In 3D sand and gravel stay where
  they are placed, liquids pool outward in all four directions instead of
  pouring down, dropped items skid across the floor and settle (with a hover +
  shadow) instead of arcing, and vehicles steer both axes.
- **Mobs** run a platform-walker AI in side-scroll (jump smarts, swimming,
  fliers holding altitude) and a plan-view AI in 3D — every species, fliers
  included, wanders to 2D destinations and chases, flees and bursts along both
  axes, refusing to walk into hazards on *either* axis.
- **The player** walks the whole plane in 3D, with diagonals normalized (a
  diagonal isn't √2 faster than an axis) and sprint applying in every
  direction.
- **Which way is up** — every directional effect resolves against the format's
  own axes, not a side-scroller's screen. See
  [the two physical spaces](#the-two-physical-spaces-which-way-is-up).
- **Online**, the server simulates the *served level's* format, so hosting a 3D
  level moves everyone on the plane and client prediction agrees. The camera's
  heading and tilt are per-client view state and are never sent.

### The two physical spaces (which way is up)

A format is not a camera angle with the same physics behind it. Each one loads
a **space** of its own
([`PerspectiveSpace`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/PerspectiveSpace.java)),
and that is the axis every directional thing in the engine asks before it
moves:

| | Side-Scroller | 3D |
|---|---|---|
| The screen shows | the vertical plane | the floor, from a camera standing over it |
| Up points | up the screen | out of the screen, at you |
| Gravity pulls along | world **+y** | the **elevation** axis |
| Height is drawn as | *(no height axis)* | a lift **and a growth** — rising means coming nearer |

How *far* that lift carries is the camera's tilt rather than the space's:
`Camera.liftScale()` is `cos(pitch)`, so blocks stand up as the camera comes
down and flatten into their own top faces as it is raised. It never reaches
zero (`Camera.MIN_LIFT`) — a wall drawn zero pixels tall is a wall that has
left the level, at exactly the angle a creator is most likely to build from.

**Gravity does not switch off on a plane — it turns.** The pull is the same
strength in both formats; only the axis changes. That is what makes a 3D level
feel like a floor you are standing on rather than a wall you are pinned to.

What used to go wrong without this: anything with a direction was authored in
screen terms and replayed unchanged in every format, so "up" quietly meant
**north** in a 3D level, and swung round to somewhere else again the moment
the camera turned. Meteors
called down from the sky spawned a screen's worth of pixels north of their
target and flew in sideways along the ground; embers drifted north instead of
rising; drips crawled south away from whatever they dripped off; a blast ring
tilted out of the floor it had just blasted. Now:

- **Sky strikes** (Meteor Staff, the Meteor Volley ultimate) spawn *above* the
  aim point on the elevation axis, ringed around it, and fall onto the tile you
  picked. While falling they are **over** the level — they clear walls and pass
  over heads — and they strike the instant they touch down. In a side-scroller
  they still arrive from up the screen, exactly as before.
- **Particles** spread across the *floor* (which a turned or tilted camera
  foreshortens for free) and put their upward component on the elevation
  axis, so embers rise off the ground toward you, fountains go straight up,
  shards rain back down onto the floor, and a blast ring stays flat on it.
- **Knockback** follows the whole hit vector on a plane: a mob struck from the
  north is knocked *south*, not shoved east or west because that was the only
  axis a side-scroller had.
- **Thrown stacks** leave along the direction you are facing — all eight of
  them — instead of always due east or west.
- **The side-scroller is untouched.** It is the reference format, and every one
  of the above keeps its original motion there.

### Perspectives (the projection)

`Camera` maps world coordinates to the screen via a per-perspective projection,
then applies zoom and centering. Orthographic perspectives (`SIDE_SCROLL`,
`TOP_DOWN`) use an identity projection; `ISOMETRIC` projects a square grid into a
diamond. Because the projection is the only thing that changes, the *same*
tile/sprite drawing code renders correctly in every perspective — see
`PlayScene`, which simply projects each tile's four world corners. The editor
grid goes through the same projection, so a turned camera gets a diamond
lattice to line blocks up against and a tilted one gets a foreshortened grid.

Rendering cost scales with the screen, not the level: `PlayScene` computes the
visible tile range by inverse-projecting the viewport corners
(`Camera.screenToWorld`) and only draws those tiles, so arbitrarily large
levels render at the same speed.

**The world lands on a pixel lattice the camera cannot move**, and that is what
stops it shimmering. The obvious way to write the second half of the projection
is to round once at the end — `round((world − camera) × zoom + viewport/2)` —
and it is wrong in a way that only shows in motion: the camera is a `double`
and slides continuously, so every object crosses its own rounding boundary at
its own moment. At `zoom = 1.7` a 32-unit tile is 54.4 pixels wide, and as the
view pans one tile rounds to 55 while its neighbour is still at 54, then they
swap. Blocks slide against each other by a pixel, over and over, for as long as
the camera moves. So the rounding is split in two — `round(world × zoom)`,
which has no camera term in it at all, plus a single `round(viewport/2 −
camera × zoom)` that the whole scene translates by. The picture moves as one
rigid sheet. The cost is that everything can sit up to a pixel from where a
single rounding would have put it, *uniformly*, which no eye can see;
[`CameraStabilityTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/CameraStabilityTest.java)
holds the property by requiring that every point on screen move by the same
vector when the camera does.

**The GL backend needed a second fix for the same symptom**, because a rigid
projection is not enough if the sampler is not. A 16-texel block drawn 54.4
pixels wide is 6.75 device pixels per texel, and at that ratio some texel
boundaries land exactly on a pixel centre — where `GL_NEAREST` resolves the
pixel from the last bits of a coordinate the rasteriser interpolated across the
quad, and those bits move when the quad does. The inside of every sprite fizzed
while its edges sat still. Java2D never had it, because it maps destination
column to source column with integer arithmetic anchored at the rectangle's own
origin. The GL sprite shader now picks the texel with a fixed nudge off the
boundary and reads that texel's centre, which gets the same determinism a
different way. Measured over a wall of tiles crept a quarter-pixel at a time,
GL disturbed up to 169 pixels a step beyond the camera's own shift and now
disturbs none — the same as Java2D.

A level's perspective is **fixed for its lifetime**. There is no in-game
switch, because the two formats are not two views of one world: they differ
in which axis is up, in what a block *means*, and in how many layers of them a
level is written in, so there is nothing coherent for a mid-level switch to
show. (Moving the *camera* within a 3D level is a different question entirely,
and free — turn it and tilt it as much as you like.) Walking through a door into a level of another format is how a game
changes perspective, and that works mid-play with no reload. What *can* be
switched mid-play is where you stand to look at that world — see below, and
note that the two are different questions: a level's format is what the world
*is*, a viewpoint is where the camera is.

### First and third person (the `[F5]` view)

**`[F5]` cycles the camera the way every 3D game does** — plan view, first
person, third person behind, third person in front — in any level with a height
axis (3D). It is the same world, the same blocks and the
same simulation; what changes is that the second, third and fourth stops are
drawn from *inside* the level through
[`EyeCamera`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/EyeCamera.java) and
[`SolidPainter`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/SolidPainter.java)
rather than flattened onto it by `Camera`.

| Stop | What you see |
|---|---|
| **Plan view** | The level's own projection — everything above, unchanged. Where a session starts, so nothing looks different until you press the key. |
| **First person** | Behind the eyes. Your body is not drawn; the object in your hands is, in the corner of the screen. |
| **Third person** | Over the shoulder, looking the way you look. |
| **Third person, front** | In front, looking back at you. |

A **side-scroller cycles nothing** and says so. Its screen *is* the vertical
plane: there is no third axis to stand an eye in and no heading to look along,
which is the same reason its camera does not rotate.

**What makes it 3D is one divide.** `Camera` is a parallel projection — a block
a hundred tiles away is drawn exactly as large as the one under your feet.
`EyeCamera` has a position in three dimensions, a heading, a tilt and a field of
view, and it divides by depth. That divide is the whole feature: parallel lines
converge, a corridor narrows, walking forward makes things grow. The two are
separate classes because they share nothing but a viewport — the flat camera's
pixel lattice, its eight-point heading and its terrain cache all exist to stop a
*parallel* projection shimmering, and none of it means anything once there is a
perspective divide.

**Two culls do all the work, and neither is a heuristic.** A face with a solid
block against it can never be seen, so it is never queued — a hillside of ten
thousand blocks has a few hundred exposed faces, and the rest cost one array
read each to reject. Of the six faces of a box the eye can see only those whose
outward normal points at it, and for an axis-aligned box that is a comparison
rather than a dot product: the top is visible when the eye is above it, the
north face when the eye is north of it. Measured on a 128×128 level of rolling
terrain at 1280×720 with a 20-tile view distance: **2.8 ms a frame** through
Java2D, sky and all.

**Depth without a depth buffer, and it is exact.** Requirement #4 says the
JDK-only build is the one that must work and Java2D has no depth buffer, so this
is a painter's algorithm like every other pass in the engine. It sorts on **how
many cells away from the eye's own cell each face's cell is**, counted along the
three axes (`SolidPainter.cellOrder`), and that ordering is a proof rather than a
heuristic: along any straight ray each coordinate moves monotonically, so the sum
of the three never decreases along it; so a face hit before another has a sum no
larger; so drawing in decreasing order of it puts every occluder over what it
occludes, and two faces that tie cannot occlude each other at all. It rests on
one thing — **a face belongs to exactly one cell** — which is why side faces are
drawn per block rather than merged up a column. Merging them was the previous
scheme, sorted on the nearest corner of each run's box, and it is wrong in
exactly the case players report: a tall wall whose nearest corner is at your
elbow drawn over the block standing halfway along it.

**Actors are the scene's own sprites, billboarded.** A mob is not just an image:
it is an image plus a health bar plus status tints plus whatever it is holding,
drawn by a method the plan view needs to go on using. So the scene draws exactly
what it always draws and the painter puts a transform under it — every sprite in
this engine is an upright box around a *ground contact point* scaled by the flat
camera's zoom, so mapping that one point to where the perspective camera puts it
turns the whole sprite into a correct billboard. A billboard is a sprite that
always faces the viewer, which is what a flat sprite already was.

**The crosshair replaces the mouse pointer.** In a plan view the mouse points at
the world; in a solid view it is steering the eye, so what you are aiming at is
whatever the middle of the screen is on. That is found by marching the eye's ray
through the block volume (`SolidPainter.pick`), which answers with the same
`TerrainPainter.Aim` the plan view's own pick returns — so mining, placing, the
reach test and everything downstream is written once and never learns which
camera asked. The ground is given the box below zero it would have if it were a
block, because layer 0 is a *surface* with no thickness and a ray aimed at the
ground would otherwise go straight through the world.

**Looking around.** Move the mouse to look. The pointer is **hidden** while a
solid view is up — the crosshair is the pointer here, and an arrow sliding
across the world that the game ignores is the second one — and it is **carried
back to the middle of the window as it nears an edge**
([`Pointer`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/input/Pointer.java), which the
window installs and which is a no-op where the platform cannot do it), so a turn
is never cut short by running out of desk. Recentring happens at the edges
rather than every frame because the event carrying the warp arrives a frame
later: in the middle of the window the reading is exactly what the hand did.
Where the pointer cannot be moved at all, resting it in the outer tenth of the
window keeps turning instead. `,` and `.` — the plan view's camera-rotate keys — turn the eye too, and
`Home`/`End` tilt it, for anyone who would rather not steer with the mouse.

**Both** windows answer that request now, and only one used to. Hiding a cursor
is a property of a window, so the view can only ask and the window has to
answer — and the GLFW window, which is the one you get whenever the GL backend
is chosen, had never registered an answer. A player on it steered a
first-person view with the desktop's arrow sliding over the world, and nothing
in the engine could tell. It answers with `GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED`, which is a
real pointer lock rather than AWT's approximation of one: the cursor is hidden
*and* the position reported is virtual and unbounded, so motion is motion
however far your hand travels. That window says so
([`Pointer.Handler.holdsPointer`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/input/Pointer.java)),
and the view then does neither of the things above — no recentring, no
edge-steering, because both are workarounds for a limitation it does not have,
and each of them costs something: a recentre throws away the frame of motion it
lands on, and edge-steering would read a virtual position resting far outside
the window as a player leaning on the edge.

Registering that handler was the obvious half of the fix and it was not the
half that mattered. **Every GLFW window function may only be called from the
thread that created the window** — which here is the one pumping events, while
a scene asks for the pointer from the *game loop's* thread. A request made from
there is undefined behaviour: on X11 it happens to work, on macOS it is a crash
rather than a no-op. So the request is recorded and carried out by
`GlWindow.pumpEvents()`, at most one pump — two milliseconds — later.
[`GlPointerTest`](gl/src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/gl/GlPointerTest.java)
checks it on a real GLFW window and asks from another thread on purpose, since
a test that asked from the right one would pass against the broken version;
`xvfb-run ./gradlew :gl:test` runs it under a software rasteriser.

The pointer comes back on the pause screen, in any panel you open, in the plan
view, and on the way out of the scene — all four, because a hidden cursor left
behind is a menu nobody can click
([`PointerTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/PointerTest.java)).
Everything about the view is **local to the client**: like the flat camera's
heading it is never networked, so two players in one world can be standing in
entirely different views.

**Block faces are textured**, from the same `blocks_top` / `blocks_side` pools
the plan view resolves and with the same fallbacks, so a texture pack dresses a
block once and it is that block in every view. The sheet goes on **in patches**
(`SolidPainter.drawTextured`), and that is the whole of why the surfaces stay
flat. The only warping blit Java2D has is affine, and a perspective quad is not
an affine image of a rectangle: three of its corners decide the map and the
divide puts the fourth somewhere else. Over a whole face that is what a player
sees as the surface *bending and folding* — worst on the floor underfoot and on
any wall seen at an angle, which is most of a frame. So a face is halved, in its
own texture coordinates, until each piece is nearly a parallelogram on screen —
until its four projected corners are within four pixels of forming one — and an
affine map over such a piece *is* the perspective map to within a quarter of
that. Which edge is halved is whichever is longer **on screen**, since a defect
falls with the product of the two splits and strips across one axis converge far
too slowly to afford. A face square-on to the eye is already a parallelogram and
is still exactly one blit, which is most of what a frame draws; the tile at your
feet is a handful. Each patch is grown by the error its own fit is known to
have, so neighbours overlap by a fraction of a pixel rather than parting to show
a seam, and only a face that was actually split pays for a clip.

The same halving is what carries a texture onto the block you are standing
**against**. Stand beside a wall rather than facing it and it runs from in front
of your eye to behind it: two of its corners are behind the near plane, the quad
cannot be projected as a whole, and the rule used to be that such a face fell
back to a flat fill — so the nearest and largest face in the frame lost its
sheet, and lost it exactly when you walked up to it. A patch with a corner
behind your eye still cannot be drawn, but it can be *cut down* until the part
that can be is, and what is finally left over is a sliver a texel wide against
the near plane, which is behind your own nose. Faces a few pixels across still
keep the flat fill, because at that size a sheet is a smear of its own average
colour. The four-level face shading is
**baked into the sheet** (`SolidTextures`), which also hands Java2D an *opaque*
image wherever the sheet has no transparent pixel in it — a warped blit of one
of those is a read and a write per pixel where a maybe-translucent one is a
read, a blend and a write, and it is worth about a tenth of the pass. Nine
milliseconds a frame at 1280×720 over an open plain at eye level, against two
and a half for the same view untextured; `SolidTextureMapTest` checks the result
against a per-pixel ray cast, which is what says the texture is where the
perspective puts it rather than merely somewhere plausible.

**Actors throw a shadow on the ground** — a soft patch on the surface under
them, queued as an ordinary face so the terrain in front of it covers it like
anything else. A billboard is a flat picture standing in the air; without
something under it there is no way to tell a character standing on the floor
from one hovering a block above it.

**What the solid views do not draw yet.** Scenery and surface decor, the editor
grid, painted doors, the parallax backdrop, particles and the mini-game's floor
markings are all plan-view painters that project through the flat camera; they
are skipped rather than drawn in the wrong place. Creative mode still builds in
the plan view; the toggle is a play-mode one.

### Stacked blocks (the plan views' geometry)

3D levels build in **two layers of blocks**, and the stack
is what their geometry means — see
[`TerrainPainter`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/TerrainPainter.java)
and [`Level.walkable`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/Level.java):

| Stack | What it is | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| **Bare ground** | a hole — unwalkable | a plan view has no "down" to fall along, so a gap in the floor is simply somewhere you cannot go |
| **One layer** | a pathway to walk along | the block grid *is* the floor |
| **Two layers** | a barrier | the stacked block stands up out of the floor and reads as a wall |

This replaced the old arrangement, where a handful of `*_path` and `*_wall`
block families carried the plan views' geometry on their own. That is a thing
the camera cannot show: seen from above, a wall and the floor beside it are
both squares, and the only difference between them was a colour the player had
to learn. **Height** is the difference now, and a stacked block is drawn as
one — lifted off its own floor tile, showing the side face that lift exposes,
and casting a shadow onto the floor behind it. Every block builds either way,
so the creative palette hides nothing in any format.

Because a wall has height, it is not a layer painted over the actors but a
thing standing among them: raised blocks join the same
[`DepthPass`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/DepthPass.java) as the
trees, mobs, dropped items and players, queued at the screen row of their base.
Walking north behind a wall puts the wall in front of you; walking south past
it puts you in front of the wall — the same rule that already decided whether
you pass in front of a tree.

**Depth is which cell you are on, not where on it you are standing.** That
distinction is the whole of it at a diagonal heading, where the screen row folds
in both world axes: a cell and its *diagonal* neighbour sit at the same depth,
side by side on screen, and an actor standing on one could score a pixel less
than the block standing on the other. Sprites are billboards wider than the
diamond of
floor they stand on, so that one pixel was the difference between a player
pressed against a wall and a player with a fifth of themselves — and whatever
they were holding — eaten by the block beside them, appearing and vanishing as
they walked along the wall. So cells are compared first and where-on-the-cell
only settles ties: a block covers you when your cell is behind its, never
because of where on your own cell you happen to stand, and a block sorts behind
every actor at its own depth because a wall is something to stand against. Ties
still sort exactly, so you still pass behind a tree and then in front of it as
you walk past its trunk.

**What collides with a wall is the ground under your feet**, not the whole
body box — on a plane, and only there. Edge-on, the box *is* the character and
all of it sweeps. On a plane the box is a patch of floor and the character is a
billboard standing on it: feet on the box's southern edge, head a whole body
north of them. Colliding the whole box stopped you the moment your *head*
reached a wall, which left your feet a full body-length south of it — an
invisible barrier most of a tile deep along the south face of every stacked
block, and nothing at all along the north face, where the same rule let your
feet land exactly on it. So the plan views collide a footprint centred on the
feet
([`PlayerPhysics.walkX`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/PlayerPhysics.java)),
and you can walk up to a block and stand against it from any side, coming to
rest the same sixth of a tile out whichever way you came. Players, mobs and
mounts all obey it, and block placement measures "am I standing there?" the
same way, so building on the cell your sprite's head reaches into still works.

**Blocks stack by themselves.** Painting (in the editor) or placing (in play)
drops the block on the floor when the cell is bare and *on top of what is
already there* when it isn't — so building a wall is painting the same cell
twice, with no mode to arm first. Mining and erasing take the stack apart from
the top in the same way: wall → path → hole, one layer per click. Liquids pool
in the stacked layer, so a puddle lies *on* the floor rather than eating it.

The editor's cursor preview stands at the height the block would land at, so
hovering a stack outlines the top of it rather than the floor underneath, and
the mining-crack overlay rises onto the block being chipped.

**The light direction is the level's.** Tools → *Light Direction…* sets the
sun's bearing, and every stacked block throws its shadow away from it; the
level redraws live as the slider moves, and the bearing saves with the level
(`"lightAngle"`). One sun per level, because shadows that disagree stop reading
as light at all.

A shadow is the caster's own tile **swept** along the light as far as the
column is tall — the convex hull of the tile and its offset copy — rather than
that tile moved bodily by the reach. Sweeping is what makes it touch the
caster's feet: translated, a two-block wall's shadow started a third of a tile
away from the wall and left clean floor in between, which is the shadow of
nothing in front of a wall standing in its own light. A softer rim is filled
under the core, each of them one union of every caster in the frame so
overlapping shadows cannot stack their alpha and band the ground.

**A stack's side face is textured once per block**, not once per run. Runs are
drawn as a single extrusion for the seams and the speed, and the texture path
used to take that literally: an eight-block wall got one copy of its side
sheet stretched eight blocks tall, so a brick was eight bricks high. Each block
of the run gets its own blit, measured from the run's base with the run's own
rounding so the bands tile exactly.

**A column between the camera and the player is drawn at a quarter opacity**
rather than replaced by an outline, and only the run where the column meets the
air (`TerrainPainter.SEE_THROUGH_ALPHA`): a quarter of a block is still a
block, so the material and the shape read while the body behind shows through,
and the buried runs stay solid because fading them opens a hole in the ground
rather than a window in the roof.

**A side-scroller has one layer and is untouched.** Its blocks are drawn
edge-on, so they already show their own height; solidity comes from the block
definition exactly as it always did. Plan-view levels written before blocks
stacked are converted on load
([`Level.liftSolidsToUpperLayer`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/Level.java)):
solid blocks become stacks of themselves, passable ones stay one layer, and
the air that used to be walkable corridor becomes floor — so an old level still
plays exactly as its author drew it.

### The world simulation

The systems merged from the Side-Scroller engine all hang off one class:
[`World`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/World.java) — a
[`Level`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/Level.java) plus the mobs,
dropped items, and day/night clock simulated inside it. Exactly one `World`
is authoritative at a time — the local one in single-player and creative
play-testing, the **server's** in multiplayer (clients render replicated
entity state) — so every mode runs the identical simulation code, the same
seam the player netcode was built on.

Content is **data-driven**: the Side-Scroller engine's 18-constant block
enum, 23 mob classes, 198 item classes, and projectile type table became rows in
[`BlockRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/BlockRegistry.java),
[`MobRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/MobRegistry.java),
[`ItemRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/ItemRegistry.java), and
[`ProjectileRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/ProjectileRegistry.java).
Adding a block/mob/item/projectile is one `register(...)` call — no engine edits. Block
ids are stable contracts: they're what level grids store and what block
edits send over the wire. Light sources (torch, campfire, lantern, …) are
simply non-solid blocks with a light radius, so painting light is painting a
block, and it replicates online like any other tile.

Sprites are procedural
([`EntitySprites`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/EntitySprites.java))
so the engine stays asset-free; a game with real art draws its own images
per registry key instead.

### Projectiles & ranged weapons

The Side-Scroller engine's `ProjectileEntity` (arrows, bolts, fireballs,
thrown rocks/knives, explosions, trails) ported into the same data-driven,
simulation-seam shape as everything else:

- A [`ProjectileDef`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/ProjectileDef.java)
  is a data row — speed, damage, a **gravity factor** (0 = straight-flying
  magic, ~0.35 = an arrow's arc, ~0.8 = a lobbed rock), collision radius,
  lifetime, an optional **explosion radius**, an optional **glow** (radius +
  colour fed to the lighting pass), an optional **trail colour**, and an
  optional **drop item** (physical shots land as recoverable pickups, exactly
  like the original's throwing-knife recovery).
- Items link to projectiles by key: `ItemDef.projectile` is what a
  **ranged weapon** fires (bows consume `ammo` — arrows — per shot; staves
  fire freely) or what a **throwable** becomes (it consumes itself).
  Skeletons drop arrows, so the ammo economy closes.
- [`World.playerShoot`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/World.java)
  resolves a shot from what the player holds, and `World.step` flies every
  projectile with the same deterministic rules everywhere: single-player,
  creative play-tests, and the authoritative server. Left-click fires when
  the held item shoots; otherwise it mines/swings as before.
- Hits use the combat toggle (with combat off, projectiles are decorative
  physics), explosions deal area damage with falloff, and every impact is an
  event — offline it feeds particles + sound directly; online the server
  broadcasts it as an `fx` message so **every client sees the hit**.
- **Shaders compose:** a fireball at night carries its own point light
  through [`LightingPass`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/shader/LightingPass.java)
  (and blooms, if bloom is on) — projectiles render inside the scene, so the
  whole post-FX chain applies to them like everything else.

### Melee combat (swing, parry, lunge, dash, shield)

The close-quarters half of the same seam. Whatever a fighter is holding
brings a set of **five moves** with it
([`MeleeAction`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/combat/MeleeAction.java)),
and the timings of those moves belong to the *object*, not to the engine — so
a dagger and a war hammer play completely differently out of the same
controls, and a mob issued a Battle Axe fights the way a player holding one
does.

| Move | What it is | Keys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Swing** | The plain attack: wind-up, strike, recovery | left-click |
| **Parry** | A short catching window — a blow that lands in it deals **nothing** and leaves the attacker staggered; shots in the air are **turned around and sent home** | `V` |
| **Lunge** | A committed thrust: you travel with it, and it lands harder | `X` |
| **Dash** | Evasive footwork, **untouchable** while it lasts | `Z` |
| **Shield ready** | A *held* guard stance that soaks a fraction of everything and slows you to a walk | hold `C` |

Every move runs the same three-phase shape on
[`MeleeState`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/combat/MeleeState.java) —
**wind-up → active → recovery** — which is what gives each weapon its weight:

```
WINDUP    committed, nothing has happened yet (the tell)
ACTIVE    the move does its work: the hit lands, the parry catches,
          the dash carries, the guard is up
RECOVER   the tail you are stuck in before you can act again
```

A telegraphed hammer blow can be stepped out of. A swing lands **exactly
once**, at the tick its hit window opens, however the frame rate wobbles.

**Weapons are data rows**, like everything else here. A
[`MeleeProfile`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/combat/MeleeProfile.java)
carries reach, arc width, knockback, what a raised guard soaks, and one
`Move` (wind-up / active / recovery / cooldown / stamina / damage scale /
burst speed) per action.
[`MeleeProfiles`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/combat/MeleeProfiles.java)
**derives** one for every item already in the game from what it plainly is —
`battle_axe` chops, `throwing_knife` flicks, `iron_spear` out-reaches
everything, `diamond_pickaxe` swings like the tool it is, a staff jabs with
its pommel, an apple is a fist with an apple in it — so the whole system
works on existing content and on custom items without anybody registering
anything. A game type that wants more can say "this fights like a spear"
(`MeleeProfiles.setStyle`) or hand-write a whole profile
(`MeleeProfiles.register`).

An action a profile *lacks* simply can't be performed: nobody fences with a
pickaxe. Nine
[`MeleeStyle`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/combat/MeleeStyle.java)
presets — fists, dagger, sword, axe, spear, hammer, shield, tool, staff —
cover the ladder, and rarity buys a slightly better guard, so a Tower Shield
stops more than a plank.

**Mobs fight with the same machine.** A species can carry a weapon
(`MobDef.weapon` — the Knight has an Iron Sword, the Orc a Battle Axe, the
Royal Guard a Tower Shield) and inherits its timings, its sounds, and its
art; a bare animal fights with claws sized to it. A mob's attack is now a
real wind-up rather than an instant subtraction, hostiles **lunge** to close
the last stretch, the dodge reflex reads as a **dash**, the guard species
raise a real shield, and an armed mob can **parry your swing** and leave you
reeling.

**Everything is one simulation.** Players and mobs run the same
`MeleeState`; strikes resolve through
[`World.meleeStrike`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/World.java);
incoming blows funnel through `PlayerState.takeBlow`, which is the single
place dash frames, parries and guards get their say. Online, the server runs
its own copy of every player's machine — cooldowns, stamina, wind-ups and
guards are all decided there, so a client can no more lunge on cooldown than
it can fabricate a shot — while the client predicts with the identical code
and the stance rides the snapshot, so other players see the swing and hear
the clang.

#### Custom art and sound per item

The point of the whole thing: **an object dresses the fighter holding it.**
Two independent sheets resolve, and both are optional
([`MeleeSprites`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/combat/MeleeSprites.java)):

```
wield/iron_sword/swing/e   the player swinging an Iron Sword, facing east
wield/iron_sword/swing     …whichever way they face
wield/iron_sword           …just holding it — the idle fallback
item/iron_sword/swing      the blade's own sheet, swept through the arc
item/iron_sword            the blade's icon — the idle fallback
```

`wield/` is a full-body sheet of *whoever* is holding the object — player,
character profile, or mob — so a Frostmourne can have a two-handed overhead
swing while a dagger flicks, on the same character. **Every chain ends at
idle**, which is what makes adding melee combat change how nothing looks
until somebody draws something: with no art at all, a swing draws the
character's existing idle sheet and the built-in procedural arc.

A move's sheet plays **once across the move**, not on a loop — so a slow
hammer and a quick dagger each get the whole strip in the time they take.

Sounds work the same way, most specific first
([`MeleeSounds`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/combat/MeleeSounds.java)):

```
item/iron_sword/swing        the blade's own sound, if the pack has one
character/rogue/swing        …else this character swinging anything
player/swing                 …else any player swinging anything
player/attack                …else the generic attack the engine always had
```

Ten sound states per fighter and per object (`swing`, `swing_hit`, `parry`,
`parry_success`, `lunge`, `lunge_hit`, `dash`, `shield_up`, `shield_block`,
`shield_down`), all defaulting to silence like everything else in the pack.
In creative mode, an item's texture dialog grows an **Action state** row
covering its icon, each move's own sheet, and each move's *wielder* sheet —
with the **Facing** row on top for the wielder ones.

### Rendering backend & shaders

All drawing goes through the `Renderer` interface. The default `Java2DRenderer`
uses a double-buffered AWT `Canvas`, which is why the engine runs anywhere a JRE
does (requirement #4). Every backend honours a `ShaderChain` of post-processing
passes — see [Shaders](#shaders) for how that satisfies requirement #5 on both:
the same passes, unmodified, as CPU row stripes on Java2D and as real fragment
shaders on the GL backend.

The backend-neutral draw API that full GPU *scene* rendering needs now exists:
`Renderer.beginFrame()` returns a `DrawTarget`, every painter, widget and scene
draws through it, and `SealedSeamTest` fails the build if anything outside
`com.larsons.engine.graphics` names `Graphics2D` at all.

Sprites are batched too. Every procedurally generated mob, item, block, decor
and unit sprite is packed into one texture page by
[`SpriteAtlas`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/atlas/SpriteAtlas.java)
as it is baked, so a run of different sprites is one texture rather than one per
sprite — a busy entity phase falls from 65 draw calls to 34, and the engine's
whole generated art set fits on a single 2048×1024 page. Nothing at the call
sites changed: the factories still hand back a plain `BufferedImage`, and the
backend resolves it to its region on the way to the screen.
`-Dlarsons.render.atlas=false` turns that off.

Text is batched onto those same pages.
[`GlyphAtlas`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/atlas/GlyphAtlas.java)
rasterises each glyph once per font, colour and screen scale and packs it beside
the sprites — the shared page grows to 2048×2048 to hold both — so an inventory
row of icon-label-icon-label is one texture bind
instead of one per item — the crafting panel falls from 33 draw calls to 14.
Java2D still *draws* the text with `drawString`, because measuring said its own
glyph cache is about 3.6× faster per glyph than any per-character blit; what the
atlas gives it is the packing and the batch key a GPU backend will use.
`-Dlarsons.render.glyphs=false` turns that off, and
`-Dlarsons.render.glyphblit=true` makes Java2D draw from the pages as well.

The GL backend that consumes all of this exists and is selected at startup where
a driver answers, and it now runs the shader chain as well as the scene. The
sub-pixel stability question at HiDPI is closed too, by seven separate fixes —
"the shimmer" turned out never to be one defect. What remains of the renderer
work is camera rotation, and it is done. The camera turns to eight compass
points on `,` and `.`, easing between them and never resting anywhere else; the
grid, the block faces, the shadows and the characters' sprites all turn with it;
the movement keys mean what they look like they mean, at every heading and on
both sides of a network connection; a level remembers the heading it was built
from and opens there; the camera's *other* axis moves too — `Home` and `End`
raise and lower it freely between 0° and 90° over the floor, which is what let
the old separate top-down and isometric formats collapse into one 3D format,
and at the bottom of that travel the level is cut open into a side elevation of
the slice you are standing in. A level remembers that angle as well, and can
lock the camera to the angles it was composed for; and the floor cache knows which
headings it can still bake
— four of the eight headings, including four at diagonal projections it could
never bake before. Two players may look at one world from different directions,
which is the point rather than a bug. [`RENDER_PLAN.md`](RENDER_PLAN.md) is the
plan of record, and all four of its jobs are closed.

Whether any of it was worth doing stayed a question about measurements rather
than architecture. The
[frame profiler](#frame-profiler-where-the-time-actually-goes) splits a frame
into `scene` and `shaders` precisely so the answer could be looked up instead of
guessed, and both jobs were funded by what it said: the scene stage at 11.49 ms
of a 16.67 ms budget, and the shader stage at 5.460 ms once two passes were
switched on.

---

## Shaders

The shader system (requirement #5) is **GLSL-first**: every
[`ShaderPass`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/shader/ShaderPass.java)
carries a complete **GLSL 3.30 fragment shader** — the universal GPU shading
language (OpenGL directly; Vulkan/Metal via the standard SPIR-V translators;
WebGL after a mechanical downgrade) — plus a semantically identical CPU
implementation. The Java2D backend executes the CPU side, multithreaded
across all cores in row stripes, which is what keeps requirement #4 intact:
shaders work out of the box on any Java machine, no native bindings.

**The GL backend executes the GLSL**, and it needed no per-effect porting to do
it — that was the claim the GLSL-first design was making, and this is where it
was cashed. It compiles each pass's `glsl()` once against the shared
fullscreen-triangle vertex shader, binds the four standard uniforms
(`uTexture`, `uResolution`, `uTime`, `uStrength`) plus the per-pass extras from
`uniforms()` and `vectorUniforms()`, and ping-pongs between two framebuffers in
chain order. `uResolution` is the frame's *logical* size even at 2× HiDPI,
because that is the unit every pass measures in — scanline rows, pixelate
blocks, bloom radius, light positions — and the CPU side composes at logical
size, so anything else would put the two backends a factor of two apart on four
effects at once.

**Built-in library** (`Shaders`): grayscale, invert, color grading, vignette,
scanlines (CRT), pixelate, chromatic aberration, animated wave distortion, and
a proper multi-stage bloom (quarter-res bright pass → separable blur →
bilinear composite). The CPU loops are optimized — fixed-point arithmetic,
baked lookup maps for anything that doesn't change per frame (vignette
falloff, pixelate/chromatic sample maps), and zero per-pixel allocation — so
typical chains fit a 120 FPS budget on a desktop CPU. When no passes are
enabled the pipeline is skipped entirely and costs nothing.

**In the demo:** every level has shader toggles (master switch, global
strength, one toggle per effect) in the game-type editor (defaults) and in
Level Select → Edit Settings (per level), saved with the level. The *Export
shaders as GLSL* action writes
ready-to-compile `fullscreen.vert` + `<effect>.frag` files to `shaders/` —
drop them into any GLSL tool, engine, or your own OpenGL backend.

```java
// Programmatic use: the chain hangs off the engine.
engine.shaders().setPasses(List.of(Shaders.bloom(), Shaders.vignette()));
engine.shaders().setStrength(0.8f);

// A custom effect is one class: GLSL for GPUs + a per-pixel Java fallback.
ShaderPass warm = new PixelShader("warm",
        Shaders.fragmentShader("", """
                vec4 c = texture(uTexture, vTexCoord);
                fragColor = vec4(c.r * 1.08, c.g, c.b * 0.92, c.a);
            """)) {
    @Override protected int shade(int x, int y, int[] src, int w, int h, ShaderContext ctx) {
        int c = src[y * w + x];
        int r = Math.min(255, (int) (((c >> 16) & 0xFF) * 1.08));
        int b = (int) ((c & 0xFF) * 0.92);
        return 0xFF000000 | (r << 16) | (c & 0x0000FF00) | b;
    }
};
engine.shaders().add(warm);

// The GPU bridge: export everything as .frag/.vert files.
Shaders.writeGlsl(Shaders.allBuiltIns(), Path.of("shaders"));
```

Multi-stage effects (like `BloomPass`) implement `ShaderPass` directly and run
whatever internal stages they need, parallelized with `ParallelRows`.

**Lighting is a shader pass.** The Side-Scroller engine's lighting system
(day/night darkness with point-light cutouts) was ported as
[`LightingPass`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/shader/LightingPass.java):
GLSL-first like every pass, with a CPU fallback that computes the light field
at quarter resolution (the original's trick) and upsamples bilinearly. Scenes
feed it screen-space lights each frame — every light-emitting block on screen
plus a small player glow. It rides the same `ShaderChain` as the post-FX
(so bloom over torchlight Just Works) but has its **own toggle**, independent
of the post-FX master switch, and it deliberately ignores `uStrength`:
darkness *is* its strength. In multiplayer the time of day comes from server
snapshots, so night falls for everyone together.

## Frame profiler (where the time actually goes)

Press **F3** in any scene for a live breakdown of the frame; **F4** writes a
report next to the game. To take a comparable pair of measurements without
typing anything, use the two profile runs described under
[Rendering backends](#rendering-backends-java2d-and-opengl) — `:gl:profileGl`
and `:gl:profileJava2d`, or the matching entries in IntelliJ's run dropdown.

Every report names **the backend and the driver that produced it** at the head,
beside the machine and the build commit. A frame time without those is a number
nobody can act on — the same scene stage means very different things from the
Java2D renderer and the GL one, and this project has already lost hours of
reports to a build stamp that stopped saying which code produced them.

The engine's remaining large rendering decision is whether to move
post-processing onto the GPU as well, and the profiler is what decides it —
**which stage is worth rewriting depends entirely on which one dominates a real
frame.** An FPS counter cannot answer that; 45 FPS tells you the frame is slow,
not which part of it is. So the profiler splits a frame along exactly the lines
the decision runs on:

| Stage | What it is | What it means for the GPU question |
|-------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| `update` | Fixed-step simulation | Not a rendering cost. A GPU backend would not move it. |
| `scene` | Every `DrawTarget` call the scene issues | **The budget a GPU scene renderer competes for.** |
| `shaders` | The post-processing chain, split per pass | **The budget a GPU shader backend competes for.** |
| `present` | Acquiring, blitting and flipping the frame | Largely fixed platform cost — the floor any backend must beat. |
| `overlay` | The readout itself | Measured so it can be subtracted, not silently added. |
| `idle` | Time the frame limiter spent waiting | **Headroom.** A frame with time to spare needs no new renderer. |

Beyond the table the report gives the figures a decision actually turns on —
work per frame against the budget, headroom, sustainable FPS, the dominant
stage — and a **verdict** phrased in terms of those two jobs, including the
verdict that neither is justified yet.

### Running a measurement

**From IntelliJ:** pick **Profile (timed run, press F3)** from the run
configuration dropdown. **From a terminal:**

```bash
./gradlew runProfiled
```

Either way the profiler is *armed but not recording*. Load a level, start
playing, and press **F3** there — it records for 30 seconds, writes
`frame-profile.txt` into the project root, and stops. Press F3 again for
another run; reports never overwrite each other.

That ordering is the point. **Profiling the menu the game booted into measures
a scene that draws no world**, which is the easiest way to get a confident
wrong answer out of this.

```bash
./gradlew runProfiled -Pprofile.seconds=60      # longer sample
./gradlew runProfiled -Pprofile.hud=true        # watch it live instead
./gradlew runProfiled -Pprofile.out=air-on.txt  # name the report
```

Driving a built jar directly works too, and is what to use on a machine
without the project checked out:

```bash
java -Dlarsons.profile.seconds=30 \
     -Dlarsons.profile.out=frame-profile.txt \
     -jar build/libs/Larsons-Game-Engine-0.1.0.jar
```

Add `-Dlarsons.profile=true` to that if you want recording to begin at launch
rather than on F3 — useful for a scene the game boots straight into, wrong for
anything you have to navigate to. Note the jar path is relative: run it from
the project root, after `./gradlew jar`, or the JVM will report
`Unable to access jarfile`.

| Property | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `larsons.profile` | `false` | Start with profiling on |
| `larsons.profile.overlay` | `true` | Draw the HUD (turn off for a clean measurement) |
| `larsons.profile.seconds` | `0` | Write a report after this many seconds, then stop |
| `larsons.profile.out` | `frame-profile.txt` | Where that report goes |

Run the same scene for the same duration on each machine you care about and
diff the reports. **Measure the weakest machine that has to hold the frame
rate, not the development one** — the numbers that decide a months-long
rewrite should come from the hardware that is actually struggling.

### Reading a result on a laptop

Every report carries the machine it was taken on, because the fields that move
frame times on the low end are easy to overlook:

- **Display scale.** The one most often missed. On a HiDPI panel a "1280×720"
  window is backed by 2560×1440 real pixels, so every full-screen CPU pass
  costs **four times** what the logical size suggests. A Retina laptop can be
  four times slower at post-processing than its specification implies.
- **Cores.** The CPU shader chain fans out across cores via `ParallelRows`, so
  post-processing is the stage that degrades first on a machine with fewer
  cores than the development one.
- **Java2D pipeline.** Whether any hardware blitting is in play at all. Note
  that enabling *any* shader pass gives it up regardless: reaching the pixels
  means `DataBufferInt.getData()`, and Java2D stops caching an image in video
  memory once a caller holds a pointer into its raster.
- **Refresh rate.** A 120 FPS cap on a 60 Hz panel spends half its frames on
  images nobody sees.

The profiler is inert when off — one predictable branch per stage per frame —
and the HUD's own cost is timed into `overlay` and excluded from every reported
figure, so the readout never inflates the frame it is measuring.

## Creative mode (paint objects)

The Side-Scroller engine's built-in level editor, rebuilt on this engine's
camera/registry architecture. From the main menu choose **Creative Mode**, pick
a format and set the new level up on the *New Level* screen (or open the editor
straight from the pause menu in a running game): a palette sidebar lists
everything the registries know, in categories —

| Category | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| Blocks   | every non-light, non-liquid block in `BlockRegistry` — 80+ of them: stone families, woods, bricks, ores, plants, hazards, crafting stations |
| Liquids  | water, lava, acid — real simulated liquids (see below) |
| Lights   | light-emitting blocks (torch, campfire, lantern, glowstone, neon…) |
| Mobs     | every species in `MobRegistry` |
| Items    | every item in `ItemRegistry`, sorted by rarity |
| Decor    | trees, rocks, bushes, crystals… painted into the background or foreground layer |
| Surface  | per-face block details (grass tufts, hanging moss, twigs, icicles, cobwebs…) with face / open-closed / layer toggles |
| Doors    | the game type's door list (external `doors.json`), each linking to another level |
| Characters | every playable [character profile](#characters-ultimates--directional-animation) — skins and traits you create with "+ New Character" — plus *Level Roster…*, which picks the ones **this** level offers at its start |
| Effects  | every particle style and projectile the game throws; click one to open its texture dialog (these aren't painted into the level, they belong to whatever throws them) |
| Sounds   | the [sound editor](#sound-every-action-state): *Sound Editor…* lists **every place the game makes a noise** (~2,000 of them, custom objects included) with what each currently plays, *Sound Options…* holds the volumes and the fresh-pitch toggle, *Level Music…* picks this level's track, and one entry per family opens the list filtered to it |
| Cutscenes | the level's scripted cutscenes — paint one to place its trigger marker; *Manage Cutscenes…* (or right-clicking an entry) opens the editor |
| Mini Game | the *Mini Game Setup…* window plus the objective markers the four team modes are built from: flag bases, stockpile crates, team spawns, escort waypoints |
| Tools    | player spawn, multiplayer spawn points, eraser, Brush Settings, **Landscape…** (the height axis, this level's ceiling, and the raise/lower/flatten/smooth brushes), the Generate button, **Light Direction…** (where the sun stands, and so which way stacked blocks throw their shadows), the Stat Rules editor, the Sound Editor |

Objects **you** created (via the "+" entries) wear a green corner badge in
the palette and say "· custom" in the caption, so they're obvious at a
glance — right-click one and the dialog offers **DELETE this custom
object** alongside its texture settings.

Every creatable category **leads with a "+" entry** — click it to define a
brand-new block/liquid/light/mob/item/decoration with fully customizable
properties (colours, solidity, light, damage, hardness/tool, AI stats,
rarity…). Creations are registered live, persist to the game type's
`custom.json`, and reload with it. The form finishes with **Create & draw
its texture…**, which makes the object and opens the
[sprite-sheet editor](#create-texture-draw-the-sprite-sheet-in-game) on it —
so a new object can be given its own art on the spot.

A new **block** is always asked one extra question: whether it comes with a
**top texture, a side texture, or both** — the faces a 3D
level sees that a side-scroller never does (see
[texture packs](#texture-packs-drop-in-art)). Whatever you answer, the form
names the exact files to draw, and a face you leave off falls back to the
block's flat sheet and then to its colour, so no answer leaves you with a
broken block.

**Editor controls:**

| Input | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Left click / drag | paint the selected entry (grid-snapped for blocks; drag keeps painting) |
| Right click (canvas) | erase — entities first, then **one layer** off the top of the block stack per click |
| Right click (palette icon) | that object's texture dialog: assign a sprite sheet, or **✎ Create texture** to draw one here |
| Middle click | pick the hovered block into the palette (the top of the stack) |
| WASD / arrows | pan the camera |
| Mouse wheel | zoom (over the canvas) / scroll the palette (over the sidebar) |
| Ctrl + wheel | move the build height (plan views) |
| Tab | next palette category |
| B | toggle the decoration layer (background / foreground) |
| [ / ] | shrink / grow the paint brush (shapes cycle in the sidebar's Brush row) |
| H | next landscape tool — Stack, Raise, Lower, Flatten, Smooth |
| PgUp / PgDn | build height up / down (off the bottom = follow the surface) |
| G | toggle the grid |
| P | play-test the level in place (terrain restored on exit) |
| Ctrl+Z | undo the last thing you did (a whole drag, or a whole window's worth of editing) |
| Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z | redo it |
| Ctrl+S / L / N | save / load / new level |
| Esc | back (with a save prompt offline) |

**Undo everything (`Ctrl+Z`).** Every action in creative mode can be taken
back, and put back again with `Ctrl+Y`. A history step is an *action*, not a
change: one brush drag comes back at once however many cells it covered, and
so does a window session, so nothing has to be walked back a cell or a field
at a time. The top bar names what `Ctrl+Z` will undo next and how many steps
are left behind it.

It covers the lot:

* **Painting and erasing** — blocks in either layer, brush shapes and
  multi-block mixes, surface details, and the things that follow a block when
  its cell is cleared (its stack, its details, a container's contents all come
  back with it).
* **Markers** — mobs, items, decorations, doors, multiplayer spawns, mini-game
  flags/stockpiles/spawns/waypoints (renumbered escort paths included), the
  player spawn, and cutscene triggers.
* **Level-shape edits** — live resizes (including the content a shrink
  dropped, and the dense grid a giant resize converted to chunks), and
  *New* / *Load* / *Generate*, which hand the level you were editing back
  exactly as it was.
* **Window sessions** — stat rules, cutscenes with their actors, animation
  states and step scripts, mini game setup, the character roster, the sun's
  bearing, the level's music track, and the game type's door directory.
* **The objects and their art** — everything "+ New …" creates and the palette
  deletes (unregistered/re-registered in `custom.json` and the live
  registries, keeping the same block id so painted levels still resolve), plus
  texture and sound assignments (`skins.json`, the pack's own exception
  files).

Three things it deliberately leaves alone. *Looking* is not an edit, so the
camera, grid, palette selection, brush settings and decoration layer are not
in the history. *Saving* is not an edit either: `Ctrl+Z` never un-writes a
level file, and never deletes a sheet drawn in the paint window — which has an
undo of its own for the drawing itself. And painting a **server's** world is
the server's to answer for, so undo is offline only; online it says so instead
of pretending.

**One creative mode per level format.** The main menu's *Creative Mode*
entry asks which format you are building — Side-Scroller or 3D (with how many
levels of each the game type already holds) — and the editor opens as that
format's creative mode: its camera projection, its starter canvas (a ground
floor to land on, or a walled 3D arena), its palette, its generator default,
and a play-test that moves under that format's rules. In 3D the editor's
camera turns (`,` / `.`) and tilts (`Home` / `End`) while you build, which is
usually easier than building a wall from straight above it — all the way to
flat on the floor, where the level is cut open along the line you are looking
down. The editor is **not** under the level's camera lock: a lock says where a
level is meant to be played from, and building it needs to see the far side of
every wall.

**Picking a format does not create the level.** It opens the **New Level**
screen ([`NewLevelScene`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/NewLevelScene.java)):
the level's name, its canvas size, and the per-level settings form, all
answered *before* anything is built. **Create Level** builds the starter
canvas for the chosen format, saves it into the game type — so a created level
is one that exists, listed under *Level Select* — and hands it to the editor.
Those decisions used to be made for you and then only changeable afterwards,
each somewhere else: the name in the editor's *Save* dialog, the size in its
*New Level* dialog, the toggles in *Level Select → Edit Settings*. When the game
type's last level is in the format you picked, the screen offers to **continue
editing it** instead, which is what picking a format used to do by itself. Any
*other* saved level opens in the editor from *Level Select → **Edit in
Creative***, which loads it in its own format with its own settings in force.
The editor's own *New Level* and *Generate* dialogs still carry a **Format**
row, so you can switch modes in place without leaving it.

Painting itself works in **every format** — the palette paints through the
same `Camera` projection the game renders with, so building from a turned or
tilted camera is the same act as building square-on, and the grid follows the
projection to give you a lattice to line blocks up against.

The **path** and **wall** block families are the one part of the palette that
is format-specific: they are plan-view geometry, so they appear while building
3D levels and not while building side-scrollers. (A level
that already contains them keeps them — hiding a family from a palette never
changes a tile.) Everything else in the palette is shared by both modes.

**Level size sliders.** The sidebar's bottom panel has live width/height
sliders: drag to resize the level in place — existing tiles are preserved,
the spawn is clamped back in, and out-of-bounds entities are dropped. The
**Override map size** button beneath them unlocks the sliders past
1024×1024 all the way to **65536×65536** (the scale turns exponential);
crossing 1024² converts the level to chunked storage transparently, and the
top bar starts reporting how many chunks are loaded/edited. The same
override appears in the *New Level* and *Generate* dialogs — a giant
generated world builds its terrain chunk-by-chunk as you pan over it.

**Brushes.** The Brush row above the size sliders picks a stroke shape
(square, circle, diamond, horizontal/vertical line, spray) and size (1-12
tiles, also `[` / `]`): one drag paints — or right-click erases — the whole
footprint, with a live preview under the cursor. **Brush Settings…** (Tools
palette) opens the full brush window: shape, size, and a **multi-block
mix** — name up to three extra block keys and every stroke scatters them
stably alongside the selected block, so one drag lays down varied terrain
(stone + granite + gravel, say) instead of a flat fill.

**Building 3D landscapes.** In a 3D level a
column of blocks is real height — you climb it, stand on it, and fall off
it — so the editor builds along that axis rather than along a floor.

- **Stack.** A click puts a block **against the face you are pointing at**:
  point at a column's top and it grows taller, point at its side and the
  block goes into the cell beside it, all the way to the level's ceiling
  (**512 blocks** by default — a large map buys fewer layers, since a dense
  layer costs its whole footprint, and the Landscape window says what yours
  allows). The cursor is aimed by a ray marched *through*
  the terrain, so what you click is what you see, not the floor tile hidden
  behind the tower. Right-click takes the top block off, whatever height it
  is at.
- **Raise / Lower / Flatten / Smooth.** The `Build` row beside the brush
  (or `H`, or the Landscape window) swaps the brush from placing blocks to
  sculpting them: raise and lower move every column under the footprint a
  layer at a time, flatten sets them all to one height, smooth averages
  each against its neighbours — which turns the staircase a raise brush
  leaves into a hill. Raising keeps the material each column is already
  made of, so pulling a hillside up doesn't repaint it, and lowering stops
  at the floor rather than punching a hole. A whole sculpting drag is one
  `Ctrl+Z`.
- **Build height.** `top` means "on whatever it lands on". Lock it to a
  layer — `Ctrl+wheel`, `PgUp`/`PgDn`, or the sidebar's `- +` — and every
  stroke builds to *that* height: a terrace cut across rolling ground, or
  a stripe of one material painted along a cliff face at layer 4. A column
  short of the lock is filled up to it and one already taller is repainted
  at that height, so a placed block never floats over a gap.
- **The cursor tells you what will happen.** It is drawn as the block (or
  the column) it is about to become, standing at the height it will land
  at, in the block's own colour; a cell with nowhere left to build draws
  **red**; a sculpting brush ghosts the layers it is about to add and
  outlines the ones it is about to remove; and a readout beside the pointer
  says `h 4/512 · Stack · on top`.
- **Landscape…** (Tools) holds the two settings the tools need: **Standing
  on blocks (height)** — off, stacks are walls nobody can climb; on, they
  are terrain — and **Ceiling (layers)**, how tall this level may be built,
  up to 512. A level that means to stay flat says so here rather than relying
  on nobody stacking.
- **Generate → Landscape (hills)** rolls a whole one: two octaves of Perlin
  noise quantised into layers, grass over stone, deterministic in the seed,
  with a relief slider for how much rise you want. It switches the height
  axis on, since terrain nobody can climb is just a maze of cliffs.

**Liquids flow.**
[`LiquidSim`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/LiquidSim.java) makes
painted water/lava/acid sources pour: liquid falls freely, spreads a
per-liquid range along floors via hidden `*_flow` blocks, and drains when
you remove the source or cut the stream. Water quenches lava into stone
(obsidian for sources), players swim (buoyant sink, hold up to stroke),
lava and other hazards burn, and on a server the flow broadcasts to every
client as authoritative block events.

**Doors reference an external list.**
[`DoorDirectory`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/DoorDirectory.java)
stores the game type's doors in `resources/levels/<game-type>/doors.json`;
each entry names a label, colour, and target level. *Manage Doors…* edits
the list; painting stamps a door into the level; walking into one and
pressing `E` (in play or play-test) loads its target level — retarget the
directory entry and every painted instance re-routes at once.

**Multiplayer spawn points** (Tools palette) are dealt out round-robin to
joining players by the server, and respawns use them too. Without any, the
single spawn marker is used, as before.

**Right-click textures.** Right-clicking a palette icon opens the texture
dialog for that object. Two ways to supply art, and the first needs no
setting at all:

- **Texture pack folder** (a per-object toggle, **on** by default) — the
  sheet is whatever sits at that object's file name inside the drop-in
  [texture pack](#texture-packs-drop-in-art) beside the jar. The dialog
  names the file it wants (`blocks/dirt.png`) and says whether it's there
  yet; click that row to rescan after adding sheets mid-session. Nothing
  there? The built-in icon stands, which is why the toggle is safe to leave
  on for everything.
- **A sheet elsewhere** — turn the pack off (or just fill in *Sheet
  elsewhere*, used as the pack's fallback) to point that one object at any
  image on disk.

A **block** picks which of its faces the sheet is for first — *flat* (the one
sheet a side-scroller draws), *top*, or *side* — so each plan-view face can be
assigned its own art here, exactly like a mob's action states. A face with no
sheet of its own falls back to the flat one, then to the built-in colour.

Either way you set frame size, count and fps (0 = static), per action state
for mobs (idle/walk/attack/hurt); frame settings for a pack texture are
saved into the pack's own `texturepack.json`, so the exception travels with
the folder. The assignment applies live everywhere that thing is drawn,
persists via the engine's `Skins`/`skins.json` system, and **the palette
swatch redraws with the new texture** — the sidebar always previews what
will land on the canvas. *Reset to defaults* puts an object back on the
pack with the procedural art as its fallback.

### Create texture (draw the sprite sheet in game)

There is a third way to supply art, and it needs no art program and no file
manager at all: **✎ Create texture** in that same dialog opens a **paint
window** over the editor
([`SpriteEditorPanel`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/ui/SpriteEditorPanel.java)).
It is offered for **every** object the palette can reskin — the blocks, mobs
and items that ship with the engine as much as the ones you made yourself —
and the "+ New …" form has its own **Create & draw its texture…** button, so
a custom object can go from "doesn't exist" to "has its own animated
sprite" without leaving the editor.

Open it on an object that already has a sheet and that sheet opens for
**editing**; open it on one that hasn't and you get a blank canvas at the
pack's frame size.

| Tool | Key | What it does |
|------|-----|--------------|
| Pencil | `B` | paint with the selected colour; drag to draw a stroke |
| Eraser | `E` | paint transparency (right-dragging erases with any tool selected) |
| Fill   | `G` | flood fill up to the colour boundary |
| Line   | `L` | drag a straight line, previewed until you let go |
| Rect   | `R` | drag a rectangle — outlined, or solid with the Outline/Solid toggle |
| Pick   | `I` | eyedropper: take a colour off the canvas |

A 40-swatch palette and R/G/B sliders pick the colour, `[` and `]` size the
brush, the wheel zooms, `Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y` undo and redo **whole strokes**
(not single pixels), and *− size / + size* changes the frame size itself,
keeping what is already drawn.

**Frame by frame, forward.** The strip along the bottom is the animation.
**+ Frame** adds a frame that starts as a *copy of the one you are on*, so
you draw only what moves — and the previous frame shows through underneath
as an **onion skin** while you do (`O` toggles it). **+ Blank** starts a
fresh frame instead, **Delete** removes one, and `,` / `.` step between
them. The **fps stepper** sets the playback rate (0 = a still image), and
the box on the right plays the animation at that rate as you draw it, so
the framerate is chosen by watching it rather than by guessing.

**Saving puts it in the texture pack.** *Save to texture pack* (or `Ctrl+S`)
writes the frames as one sheet, left to right, to **this object's own file
name** inside the [texture pack](#texture-packs-drop-in-art) —
`blocks/moon_rock.png` for a custom block, `mobs/slime_walk.png` for a mob's
walk cycle — creating the pack folder if this is the first texture anyone
made. The frame size, length and rate it was drawn at are recorded as that
texture's entry in `texturepack.json`, the object redraws with it
immediately (palette swatch included), and because the result is an ordinary
PNG in the pack folder it ships with the game, can be opened in a real paint
program later, and can be handed to someone else as part of a pack. `Esc`
backs out and writes nothing.

**Generate** (Tools palette) builds a level from Perlin noise
([`LevelGenerator`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/LevelGenerator.java)):
Minecraft-style fractal terrain, caves, depth-scaled ore veins, surface
lakes and a bottom lava ocean — fused with a Metroidvania network of carved
rooms and corridors (union-find guarantees everything connects, platform
ladders make vertical runs climbable), plus torches, decorations, treasure,
mobs, and multiplayer spawns. Same seed + size ⇒ the identical level.
Hill amplitude is capped in absolute tiles, so terrain rolls smoothly at
**any** map size instead of spiking into unclimbable mountains on tall
maps, and surface details (grass tufts, wildflowers, hanging moss,
dripstone) generate with the terrain automatically.

The Generate dialog also has a **Mode** switch: *Perlin terrain*, or
**Maze** — the automatic generator for the plan-view formats (it defaults to
Maze while building a 3D level, and to terrain for a
side-scroller). A seeded recursive-backtracker
maze is built from solid walls and walkable path floors, dressed with
torches at junctions, loot chests and mobs in the dead ends, multiplayer
spawns in the corners, and the gold key waiting in a chest at the cell
farthest from the entrance.

**Surface details** (Surface palette) attach to the face of an existing
block — click near the face you want (or pin one with the Face toggle).
The three option rows control the **face** (auto/up/down/left/right), the
**condition** (always · only while the face is *open*, i.e. not touching
another block · only while it's *closed*), and the **layer** (background,
behind the player, or foreground in front). Tall grass on soil, moss and
icicles under overhangs, twigs and shelf mushrooms on trunks — details
follow their host block and vanish when it's mined or covered.

**Stat rules** (Tools → Stat Rules…) are the map-maker scripting layer:
each rule watches a tracked stat (blocks mined/placed, items picked up,
distance traveled, jumps, kills, crafts, deaths, damage taken, shots
fired), and when it crosses the threshold it optionally **consumes** items
from the player's inventory and **grants** a reward — one-shot or repeating
every threshold step, with an optional live HUD progress bar. Rules save
with the level and run in play and play-test.

### Cutscenes (triggerable scripted scenes)

The CUTSCENES palette scripts **triggerable cutscenes** into the level. Each
cutscene has three parts, edited through *Manage Cutscenes…* (or the "+"
entry, or right-clicking a cutscene's palette icon):

- **A trigger** — *walk into it* (a zone the player enters), *press E at it*
  (an interaction marker), or *when the level starts*. Zone/interact
  cutscenes have a marker painted into the world (click the canvas with the
  cutscene's palette entry selected — repainting moves it, exactly like the
  spawn marker) and a trigger radius in tiles, drawn as a ring in the
  editor. *Play once per run* makes it a one-shot; re-triggerable zone
  cutscenes re-arm only after the player leaves the zone.
- **Actors** — the scene's cast. Each actor is a set of named **animation
  states for sprite sheets**: `idle`, `walk`, `talk`, or anything you like,
  each state its own sheet (path or *Browse…*), frame pixel width/height,
  frame count, a 0-120 fps playback rate, and a **loop** flag (off = a
  one-shot that holds its last frame — a wave, a collapse). The runtime
  plays `walk` automatically while an actor moves and `talk` while it
  speaks, falls back to `idle` for states an actor doesn't define, and an
  actor with no working sheet at all draws as a procedural stand-in figure,
  so a missing PNG never breaks the scene.
- **Steps** — the script, run in order: **SHOW** an actor at a tile
  (optionally in a named state) · **SAY** dialogue (a caption box with the
  speaker's name) · **MOVE** an actor to a tile over some seconds ·
  **ANIM** switch an actor's animation state (optionally holding) ·
  **WAIT** · **CAMERA** pan to a tile · **HIDE** an actor. A *Set X,Y to
  the camera center* button grabs coordinates from wherever you're looking.

During play-test (`P`) and play, [`CutsceneDirector`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/CutsceneDirector.java)
watches the triggers and [`CutscenePlayer`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/CutscenePlayer.java)
runs the script: the world holds still, letterbox bars ease in, the camera
follows the script, and **Enter/Esc skips** (every remaining effect still
applies, so skipping never strands actors mid-scene). Cutscenes serialize
with the level JSON, so they travel with saved levels like stat rules do.

**Play-testing** (`P`) drops a player at the spawn marker and simulates the
painted world with the real `PlayerPhysics`/mob/item code and the game
type's lighting — with a full working inventory: hold to mine blocks
against their durability (tools speed it up), pick up painted items, place
from the hotbar, sprint on stamina, cast on mana, craft at stations with
`E`, eat, shoot, take lava damage, and walk through doors (your inventory
carries across levels). The terrain is restored when you return to editing.

**Levels save into the game type** (the roadmap item):
[`LevelStore`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/LevelStore.java) writes
`resources/levels/<game-type>/<level>.json`. Saving snapshots the active feature
toggles into the level, so each level reloads with its own settings. The game
type remembers its last saved level — *Continue*, *Host Server* and the
creative editor open it, while *Level Select* lists every level in the type so
you can pick another (and choose the save slot it is played in).

**Online**, the editor opens from the pause menu and paints into the
<em>server's</em> world: strokes become protocol requests, the server
validates them against the host's feature toggles, and the authoritative
results broadcast to every player in real time (other players are visible
while you paint). Save/load/test stay offline-only features.

## Mini games (online team modes)

Any level can be turned into a competitive team game in creative mode: the
**Mini Game** palette's *Mini Game Setup…* window picks one of four modes and
its rules, and the palette's markers build the arena — all placeable
**anywhere on the map**, exactly like any other painted object. The setup
saves *inside the level* ([`MiniGameConfig`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/minigame/MiniGameConfig.java)),
so **hosting that level runs the game online** for everyone who joins, and
playing it offline referees the same rules locally for solo testing.

| Mode | Teams | The game |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Capture the Flag** | 2 | Steal the enemy flag (painted anywhere via the two *Flag Base* markers) and carry it home while your own flag is at its base. Dying drops the flag where you fell; the owning team can touch it to return it, or it flies home on its own after 25 s. First to the capture limit wins. |
| **Stockpile** | 2-4 | Teams race to bank resources at their *Stockpile* marker — walk into its ring and every configured resource item in your inventory deposits automatically. **Which item keys count is chosen in creative** (default: coal, iron ingot, gold ingot), and **PvP is a toggle**. First team to the resource limit wins. |
| **Battle** | 2-4 | Team deathmatch. Everyone spawns with a **magic-weapon loadout** (arcane staff, fire staff, sword, tools, bread); kills score for your team, first to the kill limit wins. PvP is always on. |
| **Escort** | 2 | Red escorts a payload cart along the painted waypoint path (*Escort Waypoint* markers auto-number themselves; #1 is the start); Blue stops them. The cart only rolls while an escort is beside it and no defender is in range — Overwatch rules. Reaching the last waypoint wins for Red; running out the clock wins for Blue. |

How it plays online: the server owns one
[`MiniGame`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/minigame/MiniGame.java) referee —
joiners are dealt onto the **smallest team**, spawn (and respawn) at their
team's painted *Team Spawn* markers, and every action resolves
server-side: melee swings and projectiles hit enemy players only when the
mode's **PvP rule** allows it (never teammates, never with PvP off), flag
pickups/captures and deposits happen where the server says the players are,
and kill credit follows the last attacker. State broadcasts ride alongside
snapshots as `mg` messages, driving every client's HUD — team score pills,
the escort progress bar + clock, your team banner, flags, the payload cart,
and team-coloured rings under every player. Announcements ("X took the Blue
flag!") reuse the ordinary server event feed. When a team wins, the winner
banner shows and the round **resets automatically** a few seconds later:
scores clear, objectives reset, and everyone respawns at their base.

Building checklist (creative): pick the mode in *Mini Game Setup…*, paint
the mode's markers (CTF: both flag bases · Stockpile: one crate per team ·
Escort: 2+ waypoints), optionally add per-team spawn points (every mode uses
them; without them teams fall back to their flag/stockpile/path ends), then
save and host. The setup window tells you what's still missing.

## Movement, worlds & storage updates

A batch of gameplay and editor refinements layered onto the systems above:

- **Double jump, always** — one mid-air jump is built into
  [`PlayerPhysics`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/PlayerPhysics.java);
  carrying a *Feather Charm* unlocks the triple, a *Sky Totem* two more, and
  the mythic *Wings of Icarus* jump forever (generated treasure rooms hide
  them). Swimmers now get a **water-exit jump**: stroking up with your head
  at the surface converts into a real jump that clears the pool's lip, and
  resting on the level's bottom edge counts as ground (both were traps that
  locked movement before).
- **The player is exactly 1×1 blocks** — `playerSize` locks to `tileSize`,
  so the player fits perfectly through one-tile gaps in every game type.
- **Three level formats, one game** — every level *is* a side-scroller, a
  or a 3D one ([`LevelFormat`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/LevelFormat.java)),
  each with its own creative mode, and every level plays in the format it was
  built in — including through a door from one format straight into another,
  which swaps the camera and the movement model mid-play. The **path** and
  **wall** families paint only in the 3D mode; everything else — mobs,
  items, blocks, decorations, lights, liquids, vehicles, cutscenes, mini games
  — is offered in both and behaves in both: mobs run format-specific
  AI (platform walkers with jump smarts in side-scroll, full-plane
  wander/chase/flee in 3D), liquids pour down or pool outward,
  sand/gravel fall only under gravity, dropped items arc-and-bounce or
  scatter-and-hover with a shadow, the player's diagonals are normalized on the
  plane, and sprite-sheet block textures warp correctly into a turned or tilted
  floor instead of falling back to flat colours.
- **Chests & barrels are real storage** — stand next to one and press `E`:
  its second inventory opens ([`ContainerPanel`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/ui/ContainerPanel.java)),
  and the contents **save inside the level data** (`containers` in the level
  JSON). Mining the block spills what it held.
- **Tool durability** — tools carry a wear budget (`ItemDef.maxDurability`)
  and break completely when it runs out, with a green-to-red wear bar under
  the icon; the hotbar also names the selected item, and hovering a recipe
  at a crafting/alchemy station shows it in plain text
  ("2× Planks + 1× Stick → 4× Platform").
- **Food that feeds** — eating restores health directly, stamina alongside,
  and rare-or-better delicacies restore mana too (same rule offline and on
  the server).
- **Sand & gravel fall** — unsupported granular blocks drop cell-by-cell
  (custom blocks opt in with the "+ New Block" form's *falls* toggle), and
  **water can't be mined** — cover it with a block to displace it. Glass is
  now a solid, genuinely transparent pane.
- **Destructible decorations** — trees, rocks, bushes and such carry an
  optional hitbox: a few swings (an axe chops double) break them down into
  resources — logs + leaves for trees, stone for rocks…
- **Bigger mobs can actually reach you** — attack/detect ranges measure from
  the mob's body edge, not its top-left corner.
- **Softer feedback** — the hit/hurt effects are gentle sine thuds instead
  of the old alarming square-wave shrieks.
- **Texture pack folder** — a `textures/` folder beside the jar reskins the
  game by file name alone ([Texture packs](#texture-packs-drop-in-art)); the
  texture dialog toggles it per object, *Browse…* starts there, and bare
  sheet filenames resolve against it. Surface details (grass, spikes…) are
  sprite-sheet skinnable like everything else (`surface/<key>`), and the
  stat-rule editor's reward/consume fields grow **look-up cyclers** over the
  whole item catalog so nobody memorizes keys.

## The menagerie, the reliquary & the garage

A content expansion across three fronts — mobs, magic items, and rideable
vehicles — all simulated in the shared
[`World`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/World.java), so every one of
these behaves identically in single-player, the creative play-test, and on
the authoritative multiplayer server (clients render replicated snapshots;
none of it can be conjured client-side).

### Mobs with jobs

The roster nearly triples (~48 species), and species are no longer just stat
rows — [`MobDef`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/MobDef.java) gained
`projectile` (ranged species open fire from their attack range) and an
`ability` (a per-species trick layered onto the shared AI state machine):

- **Marksmen** — *Skeleton Archer* (arrows), *Goblin Slinger* (rocks),
  *Dark Ranger* (knives) fight at range; their shots are mob-owned
  projectiles that never hit other mobs and hit players without any PvP rule,
  exactly like a melee strike. Mobs also stopped dodging their own side's
  volleys.
- **Elemental casters** — *Fire Imp* and *Pyromancer* burn, *Ice Witch*
  chills, *Storm Caller* chains lightning, *Venom Spitter* sickens,
  *Banshee* wails shadow, and the *Ancient Dragon* rains fireballs.
- **Ability specialists** — *Shadow Panther* **pounces** (LEAP), *Wild Boar*
  and *Sand Scorpion* **charge** with a rooted windup, *Shadow Wraith* /
  *Frost Revenant* / *Void Stalker* **blink** next to their prey (TELEPORT),
  *Necromancer* and *Spider Queen* **summon** minions, the *Giant Slime*
  **splits** into two slimes on death, the *Boomshroom* **detonates** on
  death (chains of exploders resolve as a proper chain reaction), *Troll*
  and *Treant* **regenerate**, the *Vampire* **lifesteals**, and *Stone
  Golem* / *Royal Guard* cycle a briefly-invulnerable **shield** stance
  (rendered as a glowing ring).
- **Wildlife** — *Yeti*, *Harpy*, *Griffin*, *Ember Wisp*, *Plague Rat*,
  *Turtle*, *Penguin*, *Firefly* round out the calmer corners.
- **Essence loot** — elemental species drop their school's essence
  (*Fire/Frost/Storm Essence*, *Venom Gland*, *Shadow Essence*, *Void
  Shard*), the alchemy reagents the new staves are brewed from; the phoenix
  drops its feather.

Elemental **statuses** live on the mob (`burn`/`chill`/`poison` timers plus
the shield flag), tick in its own deterministic step, and ride snapshots as
a status bitmask — so a burning zombie glows, sheds embers, and dies of its
burns on every client at once. Chilled mobs move at half speed; poisoned
ones drip.

### Relics & the elemental arsenal

The item catalog grows elemental staves, area weapons, and a shelf of relics
([`ItemRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/ItemRegistry.java)):

- **Elemental staves** — *Ember Wand*, *Frost Staff*, *Storm Staff* (chains
  to a second target), *Venom Staff*, *Void Staff*; each fires its school's
  bolt with matching impact particles (embers float, ice shards rain,
  sparks snap, venom drips) via the styled particle system.
- **Explosives & AoE mining** — thrown *Bomb* / *Mega Bomb* and the *Meteor
  Staff* (a three-meteor salvo called down from the sky above your aim)
  explode for area damage **and shatter terrain**: `ProjectileDef.breakRadius`
  mines every block in the crater, popping drops, honouring the game type's
  block-editing toggle, and broadcasting each broken tile as an
  authoritative block event online. The *Harvest Staff* is the pacifist
  version — it shatters terrain into drops and harms no one.
- **The Warp Staff** — the completely-new one: its bolt deals a scratch, but
  wherever it lands, *the caster follows*. Aimed teleportation as a weapon
  slot, resolved server-side so it works (and can't be faked) online.
- **Relic passives** — carried anywhere in the inventory, applied each tick
  from the *server's* copy online (`Inventory.applyPassivesTo`): *Hermes
  Boots* (+35% speed), *Gravity Amulet* (slow fall), *Aether Wings* (hold
  jump to **fly**), *Magnet Charm* (4× pickup vacuum), *Power Gauntlet*
  (+6 melee) — joining the Feather Charm / Sky Totem / Wings of Icarus
  triple-to-infinite jump family, whose bonus now correctly applies on the
  server too.
- **Relic actives** — hold one and press `F`: the *Nova Crystal* detonates
  an arcane ring around you (30 mana), the *Tremor Totem* quakes the ground
  into drops (25 mana).
- **The Phoenix Feather** — dying consumes it and revives you *in place* at
  half health in a fountain of embers, instead of respawning. Works online:
  the feather burns out of your server-side inventory.
- **Scatter Bow** — fans three arrows per drawn arrow.

New particle styles (`FOUNTAIN` geysers, `IMPLODE` collapsing rings) join
the burst/ember/shard/spark/drip/ring/mote set, and every ability has wire
FX — blinks, summons, warps, novas, tremors, chain arcs, and revives all
broadcast as `fx` events so everyone sees the same fireworks.

### Vehicles & mounts

Rideables are a fourth replicated entity family
([`VehicleDef`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/VehicleDef.java) /
[`Vehicle`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/Vehicle.java) /
[`VehicleRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/entity/VehicleRegistry.java)),
obtained through the ordinary item economy: craft the item, press `F` to
deploy it, walk up and press `E` to ride, `E` again to dismount, and a swing
at the empty vehicle packs it back into its item so mounts are never lost.

- **Ground mounts** — *Horse* (fast, real jump), *Ostrich* (faster, huge
  jump), *Battle Boar* (rams mobs at speed for contact damage).
- **Fliers** — *Magic Carpet*, *Broomstick*, and the *War Dragon*, which
  breathes fireballs when its rider attacks (shots are rider-owned, so PvP
  rules and kill credit apply normally).
- **Boat** — floats up to the surface and skims across water, sluggish
  ashore.
- **Drill Machine** — the creative one: a tunneler that grinds through
  terrain it's driven into (hold *down* to dig a shaft), popping block drops
  and broadcasting every broken tile.

While mounted, your input drives the vehicle's own deterministic physics
(the same AABB collision players use) and you're locked to the saddle.
Online, the server validates mounting (`mount`/`dismount` messages — near
the vehicle, saddle free), simulates every vehicle, and replicates them in
snapshots (`veh`); the riding client *predicts* its vehicle with the same
step and blends toward the server state, exactly like player prediction, so
a gallop feels instant at any ping. Levels can also declare vehicles in
their entity lists (`{"kind":"vehicle","type":"horse",…}`).

## Characters, ultimates & directional animation

Who you play as, what they can do, and which way they are drawn — three
systems that arrived together, all built on the same seams as everything
else: created from the creative palette like a block, persisted with the game
type, and resolved in the one authoritative
[`World`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/World.java) so they behave
identically offline, in the play-test, and on the dedicated server.

### Directional animations

The direction a character faces picks the sprite that draws them
([`Facing`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/Facing.java)):

- **Side-scroll** — two directions. Facing right, the **right arm swings in
  front of the torso and the left behind it**; facing left, the reverse. It
  is one drawing and its mirror, which is exactly what makes the near arm
  stay near through a turn. Nothing about the side-scroller changed when the
  overhead pool below arrived: it has no camera tilt to cross a threshold with.
- **3D** — **all eight** compass points (E, NE, N, NW, W,
  SW, S, SE). Walk north and you are drawn from behind; walk south and you
  are looking at the camera; the diagonals are three-quarter views.

Mobs use the same system, so a slime chasing you north-east is drawn turned
away, not mirrored in profile.

**Every direction has pre-generated fallback art**
([`DirectionalSprites`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/DirectionalSprites.java)):
a four-frame walk cycle drawn per facing, with far limbs shaded behind the
body and near limbs in front, so a game with no art at all already reads as
directional. Supply real art whenever you like — the resolution runs from
most specific to least, and stops at the first sheet that exists:

```
player/walk/ne   ->  player/walk_ne.png   this facing's own sheet
player/walk/nw   ->  player/walk_ne.png   the eastern twin, drawn mirrored
player/walk      ->  player/walk.png      one sheet for every direction
player/idle      ->  player/idle.png      the state fallback chain
                                          … then the generated art
```

The same nesting works for mobs (`mobs/slime_walk_e.png` → `mobs/slime_walk`
→ `mobs/slime`) and for a character profile's own sheets
(`player/rogue_walk_ne.png`). In creative mode, right-click any of these and
the texture dialog grows a **Facing** row: leave it on *(every direction)* —
the normal case — or assign one compass point at a time.

**Two pools, and the camera picks between them.** Everything above draws a
person *standing in front of you*, and a 3D level's camera does not stay in
front of them: raise it past **75°** and you are looking at the tops of the
walls, the tops of the blocks, and — until now — at one full-length standing
figure pasted flat on the floor. So there is a second pool of art under a
`topdown` segment, and the camera's tilt chooses it
([`PlayerSprites.overhead`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/PlayerSprites.java)):

```
player/walk/n            ->  player/walk_n.png            over the shoulder
player/topdown/walk/n    ->  player/topdown_walk_n.png    from overhead
character/rogue/topdown/idle                              a profile's own
```

Both pools fall back through states and directions the same way, and both end
at generated art rather than at nothing —
[`DirectionalSprites`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/DirectionalSprites.java)
for the standing view and
[`TopDownSprites`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/TopDownSprites.java)
for the overhead one, which draws head, shoulders and the arms and feet
swinging out from under them, as one east-facing figure turned to each of the
eight headings. Drawing overhead art is therefore optional, and a game that
never draws any still reads correctly from above.

The overhead pool does **not** fall back to the standing one, deliberately:
serving standing art from up there is precisely the picture the second pool
exists to stop, and it would do it silently. A character with no overhead art
of its own is drawn by `TopDownSprites` in its own body colour — a plainer
picture of that character, but a picture of it from the right place.

### Character profiles

A **character profile** is a skin plus the traits that make someone feel
different to control
([`CharacterProfile`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/character/CharacterProfile.java)):

| Trait | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| Body / skin colour | tints the generated directional art (real sheets override it entirely) |
| **Sprite size** | how large they are **drawn**, in blocks — 0.2 to 8 |
| **Hitbox size** | how much floor they **occupy**, in blocks — 0.2 to 8, set independently |
| Speed | multiplies walk and sprint speed |
| Sprint | whether Shift sprints at all |
| Mid-air jumps | 1 is the classic double jump; 0 grounds them; up to 8 |
| Jump height | multiplies take-off velocity — side-scroll jumps and plan-view hops alike |
| Max health / mana / stamina | this character's own pools, not the engine's defaults |
| Ultimate | which signature ability they bring, and a switch to turn it off |

They are created **exactly like a custom block or mob**: the creative
palette's **Characters** category leads with a **"+ New Character"** button,
and the form edits every field above. Create saves it into the game type's
`characters.json` beside its levels
([`CharacterStore`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/character/CharacterStore.java))
and registers it live, so it is immediately paintable-adjacent in the palette,
right-clickable for its skin, and deletable from that same dialog.

**How big a character looks and how big they *are* are two numbers**
([`ActorSize`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/ActorSize.java)), and mobs
work the same way. They were one number, and one number is exactly what stopped
a creator using their own art: a 64×64 character drawn at the engine's 0.9 of a
block is a postage stamp, and the only way to enlarge them was to enlarge their
body — which walls them out of every gap they used to fit through. So the
sprite says how large they *look* and the hitbox says how much floor they
*stand on*, and neither is derived from the other. A boss can tower three
blocks over the corridor it is walking down; a pebble-sized sprite can be a
boulder to walk around. Sizes are authored **in blocks, not pixels**, because
"two blocks tall" means the same thing in a 16-pixel game type and a 96-pixel
one — and because it is the sentence a creator can picture.

The **minimum is a fifth of a block** (small enough for a rat or a fairy, large
enough to stay a character rather than a smudge) and the **maximum is eight**,
which fills a good part of the screen at any ordinary zoom. The game type's own
*Tile size* row still sets the **default** both sizes fall back to, so a game
type that never touches any of this plays exactly as it did.

**The form draws what you are deciding.** "Sprite 3.4 blocks, hitbox 0.6
blocks" is not something anyone can see, so the *+ New Character* and *+ New
Mob* dialogs carry a live
[`ActorPreview`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/ActorPreview.java)
beside them: the actor at its size, standing against a wall with a one-block
doorway beside it, its footprint outlined on the floor, in the level's own
projection. It is rendered through the same terrain painter and depth pass the
game uses — a preview that draws its own approximation is one that lies the
moment either side changes — so what it shows is what play shows, including
that the character is drawn *in front of* the wall they are touching at every
size. The character picker draws its roster to scale against each other for the
same reason, so a line-up with a giant in it looks like one.

**Each level decides which characters it offers.** The Characters palette's
*Level Roster…* window (and the same toggles on the *Level Select → Edit
Settings* screen) tick the profiles this level allows; the roster saves inside
the level file. When the level starts, a **character picker** shows a card per
profile — its sprite walking, its traits, its ultimate — and the one you
choose is applied to the simulated player: pools resized, speed and jumps
retuned, ultimate meter reset. A roster with one entry skips the picker; an
empty roster means *every* profile, so a level built before profiles existed
is never unplayable.

### Ultimate abilities

Each profile can carry one **ultimate**
([`Ultimates`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/character/Ultimates.java)),
charged the way an Overwatch ultimate is: a slow passive trickle plus a much
faster gain **per point of damage dealt**, so a player who fights earns theirs
long before a player who hides. A full meter fires once on **R**, spends
itself entirely, and — because every one of them is radial, aimed, or
self-targeted, with no assumption of a "down" — **plays the same in
side-scroll and 3D**.

| Ability | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Overdrive** | Move half again as fast and hit twice as hard for 8 seconds — stamina never runs dry |
| **Nova Burst** | Detonate a ring of arcane force around you, damaging everything within four tiles |
| **Bulwark** | Shrug off 80% of incoming damage and regenerate steadily for 7 seconds |
| **Blink Strike** | Flash to where you are aiming, cutting down everything along the way |
| **Meteor Volley** | Call five meteors down onto the spot you are aiming at |
| **Time Dilation** | Freeze the tempo: everything within six tiles crawls for 6 seconds |
| **Life Siphon** | Drain the life out of everything near you for 5 seconds, healing yourself |
| **Earthshatter** | Slam the ground: a shockwave hurls enemies back and the terrain around you shatters |

The meter is a bar across the bottom of the HUD that pulses when it is ready
and counts down while a sustained ability runs. Resolution lives in
`World.useUltimate`, so online it is a request
(`{"t":"ult","x":…,"y":…}`) the **server** validates against its own copy of
your meter — nobody casts one they haven't earned. A game type with combat
switched off simply keeps the charge instead of burning it on nothing.

### Jumping in every perspective

In 3D levels the tile grid is the **floor**, so gravity has
moved off it onto the elevation axis and **Space** lifts you along that instead
([`PlayerState.z`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/PlayerState.java)):
you rise, hang, and settle back down over your own **shadow**, which shrinks
as you climb. It is a real jump, not a decoration — steering keeps working
mid-air, the character's air jumps apply, it costs the same stamina, it feeds
the `jumps` stat rule, and while airborne you clear contact-damage tiles
(lava, spikes) exactly as a side-scroll jump does. The jump/fall animation
states play off it too, so a per-state sprite sheet animates a hop.

**Space is the jump key, and the only one, in both formats.** `W`/`Up`
used to jump as well, which made them unusable as what they actually are — a
direction. They now only ever mean *up*: stroking toward the surface while
swimming, climbing while flying, walking north on a plane. Mounts follow the
same rule, so steering a flier no longer vaults it.

### Particle & projectile textures

Every particle style and every projectile is a **texture key of its own**, so
the effects layer is as reskinnable as the world:

```
particles/burst.png      particles/embers.png     particles/shards.png
particles/sparks.png     particles/drip.png       particles/ring.png
particles/motes.png      particles/fountain.png   particles/implode.png
projectiles/arrow.png    projectiles/fireball.png projectiles/ice_shard.png  …
```

Drop them in the [texture pack](#texture-packs-drop-in-art) folder and they
apply by name, or open the creative palette's **Effects** category and click
one for its texture dialog (frame size, count, fps, a sheet from anywhere on
disk). A skinned particle plays its sheet across the fleck's own lifetime and
fades out with it; an unskinned one keeps the engine's coloured fleck, and an
unskinned projectile keeps its procedural bolt — so **every effect has a
pre-generated fallback** and a missing file never breaks anything.

## Auto Battler (online, 2-10 players)

A complete standalone game inside the engine, launched straight from the
launch screen's **mini-game buttons** — the picture buttons in the corner, one
per mini game ([`StandaloneGame`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/minigame/StandaloneGame.java),
[`MiniGameButtons`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/MiniGameButtons.java))
— with no need to pick or create a game type first.
It plays like Dota Auto Chess / Teamfight
Tactics on the engine's fixed **board diamond** projection, and it is
online-first: one
player hosts (from the lobby screen, exactly like hosting a world server),
everyone else joins by `ip:port` (default port **7788**). The host can add
**bots** to fill seats — so it's playable solo against bots, with 2 friends,
or with a full lobby of 10.

**The loop.** Each round has a **planning phase** (buy from your personal
shop, position units on your half of the 8x8 board, equip items) and a
**combat phase** — a fully automatic battle the server simulates and streams
to both players. Losing costs player HP scaled by the winner's surviving
units; at 0 HP you're eliminated, and the last player standing wins. Round 1
and every 5th round are **PvE creep rounds** whose victories drop **item
components**. With an odd number of players, one fights a **ghost copy** of
another player's board.

- **Units & shop:** a 43-unit roster across five cost tiers (1-5 gold) with
  TFT-style per-level rarity odds, rerolls (2g), and a **shared unit pool** —
  copies are finite, so contested picks really run out. Three copies of a
  unit combine into a 2-star (and three 2-stars into a 3-star). Every synergy
  has several carriers, so no single build path is forced.
- **Synergies:** every unit has an **origin** (Forest, Ember, Frost, Storm,
  Shadow, Holy, Wild, Mech, Mystic, Merchant) and a **class** (Warrior,
  Guardian, Archer, Mage, Assassin, Healer, Brawler). Fielding enough
  distinct units of a trait activates tiered team buffs — regen, attack
  damage, enemy slows, crit, team HP, team spell power, even bonus gold
  (Merchant). Breakpoint ladders are deliberately **varied** (2/4, 3/5,
  1/3/5, 2/4/6…) rather than one copied system, with super-linear tier
  values. The live synergy panel shows counts and thresholds.
- **Synergy categories:** every synergy belongs to one or more functional
  **categories** (Support, Damage, Tank, Healing, Shielding, Range, Crowd
  Control, Magic, Mobility, Economy, Utility), each with its own icon.
  The synergy panel and the field guide both **filter by category**, and
  **support synergies** (Holy, Guardian, Healer, Mystic) are flagged as
  team-enhancers rather than standalone archetypes.
- **Elemental damage:** a second strategic layer on top of synergies. Units
  can attack with up to two **elements** (Fire, Cryo, Corrosive, Explosive,
  Electric, Radiation), resist up to two, and be weak to up to two — many
  carry none. Damage into a weakness is amplified, into a resistance
  dampened, and the swing **grows round over round** (Borderlands-style), so
  scouting opponents and adapting your build matters more and more late.
  Radiation is the late-game element: only cost 4+ units carry it natively.
- **Items:** five components drop from creep rounds; any two combine into
  one of 15 named completed items (two components on the same unit fuse
  automatically), all pure stat bundles applied in combat. Creep rounds also
  occasionally drop **elemental relics**: infusion charms that add an attack
  element, a Radiation Core that converts a unit's attacks entirely, and a
  Prism Ward that grants resistance to every element.
- **Economy:** income = 5 base + interest (1 per 10 gold, max 5) + win/loss
  streak bonuses + 1 for a win. XP: +2 per round, buy 4 for 4 gold; your
  **level is your board cap** and shifts shop odds toward rarer units.
- **Abilities:** units build mana by attacking and being hit, then cast
  their class ability — fireballs (Mage, with splash), heals on the weakest
  ally (Healer), armor-ignoring strikes (Assassin, who also leaps to the
  backline at combat start), and so on.
- **Longer battles:** all hostile damage is globally rescaled down (heals
  untouched) and the combat cap raised, so fights build instead of ending in
  an instant, tank-oriented builds get to matter, and abilities actually come
  online before someone's board evaporates.
- **Combat presentation:** every combat snapshot carries each unit's
  **animation state** (idle / walk / attack / cast / hit / death), so units
  visibly do what the simulation says — walkers bob, attackers lunge, casters
  flare, the hit flinch, and the dead fall as fading corpses. Idle units play
  **exaggerated, cartoony personality animations** — every species bounces,
  breathes, sways, or wiggles in its own way (phase-shifted per unit, so a
  bench of triplets never moves in lockstep). Ranged attacks
  fly as **animated projectiles** (arrows, orbs, bolts by class) that deliver
  their damage number on impact; melee hits slash, and elemental hits colour
  their damage numbers by element. Combat events name their
  **source unit**, which is what makes attacker→target projectiles possible.
- **Damage meter:** during combat the left panel lists every unit in the
  fight with how much damage it has dealt, as a stacked bar split by type —
  **attack** (physical) vs **ability** (magic) — plus healing done, live from
  the replicated per-unit tallies.
- **Board scouting:** click any player's name in the standings to open their
  board in an overlay — their fielded units (stars + items), bench, and
  public stats (HP, level/XP, gold, streak, synergies). It refreshes while
  open, works while eliminated (spectating), and Esc / clicking outside
  closes it. Clicking another name switches to that player.
- **Skinnable:** every auto-battler texture — board tiles, unit figures (per
  animation state), item gems, projectiles — checks the [skin
  system](#skins-texture-overrides) first and falls back to the procedural
  art, so a sprite-sheet drop-in reskins the game with zero code. Both the
  skin menu and the board menu have an **Import… file browser** that copies
  a picked image into the skins folder and assigns it automatically — no
  paths to type.
- **Board customization:** the lobby's **Customize Board** menu personalises
  your board — six **color schemes** (tiles, backdrop, edge glow), an
  optional **background image** (imported via the file browser), and
  **decorative props** (plants, statues, lanterns, banners, mushrooms,
  crystals, fountains) in eight slots around the board's rim, with a live
  preview. All of it is **cosmetic only** — combat and replication never
  read it — and persists to `board_theme.json` in your game files.
- **Netcode:** the same authoritative model as the world game — a fixed-tick
  server owns every rule (purchases, combines, placement legality, the
  battles themselves), clients send action requests and render replicated
  state. Battles are **deterministic and seeded**, simulated only on the
  server; clients receive ~15 Hz combat snapshots (interpolated for smooth
  motion) plus event streams for damage numbers, particles, and sounds.
  Disconnected players' boards fight on; joins after the start are refused.
- **Shaders on:** the mode always runs with its own post-FX look (bloom +
  vignette through the engine's standard `ShaderChain`), independent of the
  active game type's toggles, and restores them on exit.

- **Field guide:** the lobby's **How to Play** button opens an illustrated,
  tabbed reference built from the same data the game runs on — the round
  loop and rules, the gold economy, every synergy trait (**filterable by
  category**, with role icons), the **elements** (who attacks with, resists,
  and fears each one, plus the round-scaling rules), the item recipe
  grid and elemental relics, the per-level shop odds, and the full unit
  roster with all of their statistics. Every icon (trait, element, item gem,
  odds cell, phase node, unit card)
  is clickable and pops a detail card with the fine print — per-tier effects,
  recipes, and star-scaled stats and abilities.

**Controls:** drag a unit between the bench and your half of the board (rows
nearest you) to place it — dropping on an occupied spot swaps them — and drag
an item gem onto a unit to equip it. A plain click still works as a fallback:
click a unit then a cell/slot to move it, or click an item gem then a unit to
equip. Right-click deselects or cancels a drag. Click shop cards to buy;
click a **player's name** to scout their board; **D** rerolls; **F** buys XP;
**S** (or the red button) sells the selected unit. Hover anything for a
tooltip. **Esc** closes the scout view, else opens the pause overlay (the
match keeps running online — **L** leaves it).

**On-screen text never overlaps.** All HUD geometry lives in one place
(`AutoHud`) — panels clamp their row counts to the space they actually have
("+N more…" past that), the economy readout stays clear of the bench, shop
cards shrink on narrow windows instead of running under the sell button —
and a layout test asserts every text region stays pairwise disjoint across
window sizes and worst-case fill (a full 12-item bench, 10 players).

Customization hooks are deliberately data-driven for what comes next: units,
traits, items, creep waves, pool sizes, and shop odds are all rows in
`AutoUnits` / `AutoItems` / `Trait`, and pacing/economy live in
`AutoGame.Config`.

## Council of Six (deckbuilding board game, 2-6 online)

A second complete standalone game, on the launch screen's mini-game buttons:
**Council of Six** — a deckbuilding board game in
the spirit of **Dune Imperium** (play a card → send an agent to a board
location, buy from a shared market row, commit might to a round-end
conflict) crossed with **Inis** (persistent troops on territories, strict
majorities score) — with the rulebook kept to one screen on purpose: no
stack, no instants, no priority. Fully online, same model as everything
else in the engine: one player hosts, friends join by `ip:port` (default
port **7799**), bots fill empty seats.

**The leaders are the crew.** Every player claims one of six leaders in the
lobby — **Larson** the Architect, **Matt** the Tactician, **Dustin** the
Spellslinger, **Kris** the Quartermaster, **Bella** the Envoy, and **Eric**
the Warlord — each with exactly one always-on passive (Larson starts every
round +1 gold; Matt's first troop deployment each round adds a bonus troop;
Dustin draws 6-card hands; Kris earns interest; Bella may place an agent on
an occupied location once per round; Eric commits +1 might to every
conflict). Picks are exclusive, first come first served; anyone still
unpicked at start (bots included) gets a random free leader.

**The loop.** First to **10 VP** at the end of a round wins (8 rounds max).
Each round everyone draws 5 cards and gets 2 agents; the first-player token
rotates every round. On your turn:

- **Play** a card: send an agent to a free location matching one of the
  card's icons (Economy / Knowledge / Military / Council); the location's
  and the card's effects both resolve, and your turn ends. Eight locations,
  two per icon — The Mines, Grand Bazaar, Library of Whispers, Alchemist's
  Tower, War Camp, Mercenary Hall, High Council (2 lore → 1 VP), The
  Crossroads — and an occupied spot blocks everyone else (worker-placement
  squeeze; Bella disagrees).
- **Reveal** your remaining hand instead: its reveal values become gold to
  spend and might committed to the conflict; you keep the turn to shop,
  then end it.
- **Buy** market cards with gold any time on your turn — a shared 5-card
  row that refills from a finite market deck; purchases land in your
  discard pile and shuffle back around, so your deck grows stronger every
  round (starter decks are 10 cards; the catalog runs from Spice Merchants
  and Druids to Sandworm Riders and the Dragon of the Peaks).

**Round end**: the most committed **might** wins the round's conflict prize
(the rewards grow round over round; second place takes a consolation; a
tied top splits it), and every territory where someone holds a **strict
troop majority** scores them a VP. Troops persist — presence built early
pays every round, exactly the Inis half of the recipe.

**Netcode**: the same authoritative model as the auto-battler — a
fixed-tick [`DeckServer`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/deckbuilder/DeckServer.java)
owns every rule in a headlessly-testable
[`DeckGame`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/deckbuilder/DeckGame.java),
clients ([`DeckClient`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/deckbuilder/DeckClient.java))
send action requests and render replicated state, turn timers keep the
table moving, leavers' seats auto-pass, and disconnected games play on.
Cards, locations, leaders, and territories are all data rows
([`Cards`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/deckbuilder/Cards.java) /
[`Locations`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/deckbuilder/Locations.java) /
[`Leader`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/deckbuilder/Leader.java)) —
adding a card is one `register(...)` line.

**Shaders + particles**: the mode always runs with its own post-FX look
(bloom + vignette through the engine's GLSL-first `ShaderChain`), and every
table event is presented as a styled [`Particles`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/fx/Particles.java)
burst tuned to read through that bloom pass — agent placements flare in
their location's icon colour, buys shower gold sparks, deployments blast
rings in the territory's colour, scored VP rings gold with lingering motes,
and a conflict victory fills the table with rising embers.

**Controls**: click a hand card, then a highlighted location (troop plays
ask which territory); click market cards to buy; **R** reveals, **E** ends
the turn, right-click cancels, **H** opens the one-screen rulebook, **Esc**
pauses (the table keeps playing online).

## Evolution (artificial life simulator)

A third complete standalone game, on the launch screen's mini-game buttons:
**Evolution** — a Petri dish you scan like a microscope slide, full of
organisms that are nothing but **strands of coloured DNA**. Every rule for
reading that DNA is hard-coded and deterministic; *which* strands ever exist is
not. The game ships with an empty reference book, and the whole point is
finding out what the rules can produce.

### DNA is the animal

An organism is a sequence of **red**, **green** and **blue** nucleotides —
literally three colours of pixel — and everything about it is decoded from
that strand by
[`Phenotype`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/evolution/Phenotype.java):

- **Red encodes hostility**, **blue encodes altruism**. Each is simply its
  share of the strand, so a cell's colour (the average of its nucleotides) is a
  direct read-out of what it does — pure red hunts, pure blue cooperates, an
  even mix reads white.
- **Green is a wild card read by slot.** A green in slot *s* expresses
  `Trait.forSlot(s)` with magnitude *s*: slot 1 is speed, slot 2 consumption
  rate, **slot 3 is light emission**, slot 4 heat tolerance, 5 digestive
  efficiency, 6 memory, 7 vision, 8 pattern recognition — and the wheel repeats
  every eight slots, so a longer strand reaches the same traits at higher
  magnitudes.
- **The nucleotide after a green modifies it**: a following **red doubles** the
  magnitude, a following **blue halves** it but refines digestion, a following
  **green adds one** and chains on. (A green in slot 3 is light emission of 3;
  followed by red it is 6.)
- **Every adjacent pair also unlocks an ability**, so the same letters read
  twice — once for magnitude, once for capability:

  | Pair | Ability | Pair | Ability | Pair | Ability |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | `RR` | predation | `GR` | *(doubles the green)* | `BR` | kin defence |
  | `RG` | exothermy | `GG` | complex digestion | `BG` | broadcast |
  | `RB` | venom | `GB` | endothermy | `BB` | sharing |

- **Two abilities need a long strand**, the "eventually unlockable" traits:
  **tool use** (a `GRG` motif at slot 9 or later, in a strand that also
  recognises patterns) and **multicellularity** (`BBB` in a strand of 14+).
- **The tail of the strand governs copying fidelity** — greens near the end
  make replication sloppier, so offspring variability is itself under
  selection — and green content over the whole strand sets how fast a body
  rots back into food after death.
- **Shape follows what a strand commits to**, then feeds back as a modifier.
  Everything starts as the primordial **square** and only differentiates at six
  nucleotides: triangle (hunter), circle (altruist), star (light emitter),
  hexagon (colonist), diamond (tool user), cross (complex digester), pentagon
  (scout).

### The dish does the selecting

[`Dish`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/evolution/Dish.java) is pure
simulation — no drawing, no scene state, so the whole ecology runs headlessly
in tests at any speed. Every rule is local, and the interesting behaviour
(blooms, crashes, predator/prey cycles, colonies) is emergent rather than
scripted:

- **Scarcity.** Energy is finite. Corpses and digested waste recycle back into
  orbs — strictly energy-neutral, nothing minted or lost — so a dish is a
  closed loop a well-adapted population can ride indefinitely and a greedy one
  drains and starves in.
- **Crowding.** Upkeep rises with local density, so a bloom eats its own margin.
- **Temperature.** A diffusing heat field, pushed around by your sources and by
  the dish's own exothermic and endothermic strands; cells outside their
  evolved comfort band burn extra energy.
- **Predation**, with **pattern recognition** as the counter — prey that can
  read a hunter's colours run from it.
- **Light.** The slide has unlit patches, and sight range scales with how well
  lit a spot is, so bioluminescence and the spotlight genuinely change what the
  cells around them can find — the radius that lights the gel *is* the radius
  the simulation forages with. The light field is drawn in **world space**
  rather than through the engine's screen-space
  [`LightingPass`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/shader/LightingPass.java):
  that pass dims the finished frame, HUD and all, and the instrument panel has
  to stay readable. A gentle bloom from the shader chain is what makes the glow
  bloom.
- **Death**, from starvation or old age, so nothing stagnates.

**You can see what cells are doing.** Hunting, sharing, signalling, tool
pickups and decomposition are otherwise silent, so each throws a colour-coded
ring into the gel: a strike flashes red, a donation pulses blue at whoever
received it, a broadcast expands to its real earshot, a body handing energy
back rings the orb it just produced — which is what makes the recycling loop
legible instead of orbs appearing next to a corpse from nowhere. Cells carrying
a tool wear it as a ring in the tool's colour, and a hunter shows a notch while
its strike is off cooldown.

Neighbour lookups go through a uniform spatial grid rebuilt each tick, so a
full dish (260 organisms, 1500 orbs) costs about **1.2 ms per tick** — well
inside the 8.3 ms budget at 120 Hz.

### The game around it

You start exactly as the design calls for: **one dish, one square organism** of
whichever colour you pick, and **100 energy orbs** to place by hand.

**The colour is a difficulty choice.** Green's wild cards give it speed,
appetite and light from the first second and it is the easy opening; blue runs
frugally and shares, which keeps a colony alive; red pays the upkeep of a
predation it has nothing to hunt yet, and its only early edge is that hostility
feeds aggressively. Averaged over 40 seeded runs of a kept-fed dish, a red lab
catalogues roughly a fifth of what a green one does over the same fifteen
minutes and about three quarters of what blue does — hardest to use, but not a
dead end.

- **Credit for novelty.** Every strand that has never existed before is
  catalogued and paid for, scaled to its complexity — as is every new **colony
  combination** multicellular strands invent between themselves. Breeding
  complexity is what funds the lab.
- **The shop** sells food (simple and complex energy), life (starter colonies,
  more dishes, transfer spatulas, cell tool kits), environment (barrier
  pillars, exothermic sources, endothermic sinks, spotlights, mutagen vials)
  and three permanent **instruments**: the thermometer (temperature overlay),
  the **DNA catalog scanner** (reads a cell's exact strand instead of guessing)
  and the time warp dial (0.25× to 8×).
- **Cell tools** are dropped *for the organisms* — only a strand that evolved
  tool use can pick up a flagellum, scalpel, sieve or lantern, each with a
  limited number of uses that pass to whoever picks it up next when the carrier
  dies.
- **The run ends** when every dish has run out of life and there is no way left
  to reseed one.
- **The game can be fully reset** at any time: **Reset the lab** in the pause
  menu, or simply **New Experiment** from the front menu, which are the same
  thing — the front menu offers it once rather than as two rows that read
  differently and behave identically. Everything goes — dishes, bench,
  instruments, credits, and the game catalog itself — leaving the opening state
  with every strand to find again and every credit to re-earn. What a reset
  never touches is your **history**: every organism you have ever discovered
  stays on the permanent record, along with your achievements and lifetime
  totals. Resetting costs you the lab, never the collection.

### The reference book: this game, and everything you have ever found

Discoveries are kept in **two tiers**, which is what makes a full reset safe:

- **Game Catalog** — what the *current* game has discovered, and what it has
  been paid for. A reset empties this, because a reset is a real restart.
- **History** — every organism you have **ever** discovered, in any game, with
  the lifetime totals above it: organisms, colony combinations, games played,
  credits ever earned, shapes and abilities seen, the deepest lineage, and the
  longest and most complex strands you have produced. **Nothing is ever removed
  from here** — not by a reset, not by a new game, not by deleting the save.
  Achievements live at this tier too, so a reset never takes one back.

A strand pays when it is new *to the current game*, so a fresh game can
rediscover and be paid again; the history still records each organism exactly
once, and tells you at a glance whether the strand you are looking at is a
first-ever find or a rediscovery.

Nothing ships with the game: the book contains exactly what your dishes have
produced, and an entry decodes all the way back down to its traits and
abilities — because a strand *is* its own description. There are **24
achievements** for the finds worth bragging about (first predator,
bioluminescence, tool use, multicellularity, all eight body shapes, a strand at
the 48-nucleotide maximum, …).

On disk there are two files. `evolution/save.json` is the current game (dishes
and everything in them, the bench, the credit balance and the game catalog),
written on exit, from the pause menu, and automatically every 90 seconds.
`evolution/history.json` is the permanent record: every organism ever
discovered, the colony combinations, the achievements and the lifetime totals.
Folders of per-organism files from older builds (`evolution/history/`, and
`evolution/catalog/` from older still) are folded into it the first time it is
read, so a collection from an earlier build carries over.

**How the save stays small.** A dish holds up to 260 cells and 1500 orbs, and a
lab holds a shelf of dishes, so the parts of the save there are thousands of are
written as *packed blocks* rather than a JSON object per item: the field names
are written once for the whole list in a `format` line, each item is one line of
values, every cell's DNA is hoisted into a per-dish `strands` dictionary (a
bloom of clones therefore writes its sequence once, not once per body), numbers
are rounded to what the simulation can actually tell apart — a hundredth of a
dish unit — and fields still carrying their default are dropped off the end of
the row. A full dish drops from **299 KB to 59 KB**, and the file is still plain
JSON you can open and read:

```json
"organisms": {
  "format": "id strand x y vx vy energy age generation colony venom memory(x,y)...",
  "strands": ["GGGG", "GRGGGRRGB"],
  "rows": ["17 0 13.34 12.16 1.59 -25.74 26.92 94.97 2"]
}
```

**How the collection stays small.** The history is the one thing here that only
ever grows, and it used to be one JSON file per discovery — ~450 bytes each, of
which two thirds was decoded traits, and each one still costing a whole 4 KB
disk block. A collection of 410 organisms came to 1.7 MB on disk to hold about
16 KB of facts, and opening the book meant reading 410 files.

What a record actually has to keep is what the strand does not already say. The
shape, the colour, the traits, the abilities and the complexity are a pure
function of the DNA — recomputed on load, and never read back off disk even when
they were written there — and so are the species name and the credit it paid. So
a discovery is now one row of `dna at dish generation credit name` in
`history.json`, with the dish names in a dictionary beside it and the derived
fields written only in the odd case where they disagree with the rules:

```json
"species": {
  "format": "dna at dish generation credit name",
  "dishes": ["Dish 1", "Dish 2"],
  "rows": ["BBBBRR 1785009893 0 9", "BBBR 1785009899 1"]
}
```

Those same 410 organisms are **13.9 KB in one file** — 7% of the bytes and 1% of
the disk — and opening the book reads one file instead of 411 (9 ms → 6 ms warm
at this size, and the gap widens with every discovery). Nothing is lost: the
entry still decodes to everything it ever showed. When you want one organism as
a standalone artefact — to look at, to keep, to send someone — the store writes
it out fully decoded on demand (`EvolutionStore.exportSpecies`), which is the
readable-artefact idea aimed at the organism you care about rather than at all
several thousand of them on every save.

Saves and histories written by earlier builds still load: every packed list also
accepts the older array-of-objects form, and both older history layouts are
folded in and then cleared away — but only after the merged collection has been
written safely to `history.json`, and only for the files that were read
successfully.

### Controls

Keys `1`-`9` and `0` pick a tool (energy, complex energy, starter colony,
barrier, heat, cold, spotlight, mutagen, tool kit, spatula); `I` or `` ` ``
goes back to inspecting. **Left-click** uses the held tool, **right-drag** (or
WASD/arrows) pans the stage, the **wheel** zooms around the cursor. **B** opens
the shop, **K** the reference book, **Tab** switches dish, **T** toggles the
thermometer overlay, **[** and **]** work the time warp, **H** explains the
genetics, **Esc** pauses (and offers the full game reset).

## Field Guide (animal watching, 1-8 online)

**Field Guide** is a game about looking at things. There is no health bar and
nothing to kill: you walk an endless procedurally generated world with up to
seven friends, and you write down what you find.

The whole game is one verb repeated — *hold still, and something comes closer*
— wrapped in the reasons to keep walking: **1323 species** to catalog, twenty
biomes to find them in, food to grow and cook so that the shy ones come to you,
trees that take real days to grow and cross into varieties nobody has seen, a
house you build out of what you picked up on the way, and trading posts out
along the trails where a keeper will sell you materials for points and stamp a
fresh page in your book — so that everything you have already seen is worth
finding again, without ever leaving the guide. And, when a party wants to stop
being quiet for twenty minutes, two games inside the game: a **round of tag**
the whole walk has to vote for, and an **Eye Spy** board where one animal a day
is worth points to whoever finds it first.

### Getting in

The **Field Guide** button on the launch screen opens the lobby
([`WatchLobbyScene`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/WatchLobbyScene.java)):
continue your last walk, start a new one, **host** one for up to eight, or
**join** a friend's by address. Everyone who types in the same **seed** walks
the same world, down to the crooked pine — see *One seed, no terrain on the
wire* below.

### The world

Infinite, low-to-mid-polygon, and a **pure function of `(seed, x, y)`**
([`TerrainField`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/world/TerrainField.java)).
Nothing about it is stored and nothing about it is sent.

**Twenty biomes**, chosen by a three-axis climate field — temperature,
humidity, and a *strangeness* axis that is near zero almost everywhere and
only occasionally climbs far enough for the three fantasy biomes to claim
anything:

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pine Forest | Deciduous Forest | Desert | Rainforest |
| Tropics *(palms)* | Mountains | **Amethyst Grove** *(purple leaves)* | Autumn Birchwood |
| Boreal Taiga | Alpine Meadow | Savanna | Wetland Marsh |
| Mangrove Coast | Redwood Cathedral | Canyon Badlands | Tundra Barrens |
| Bamboo Thicket | **Mushroom Hollow** | Sunflower Prairie | **Crystal Highlands** |

The seven the brief named, plus thirteen more. Each supplies its own surface,
cliff, shore and trail materials, its own tree species, its own grass length
band and its own sky and fog. Height and relief are **blended across all
twenty** by cubed fit weights while the *materials* come from the single best
fit, which is what gives sharp biome borders over ground that never steps.

- **Trails** lay themselves through it
  ([`TrailNetwork`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/world/TrailNetwork.java)) —
  one node per 160 m cell, Bézier edges east and south, cached as sampled
  points. A path is *cut*: the ground under it is pulled toward the level of
  the undisturbed terrain in a ring around it, which takes the bumps out from
  under your feet without pretending to flatten a mountain. Measured, a tread
  is about a fifth less curvature and a few percent gentler than the country
  it crosses.
- **Tracks you leave behind**
  ([`TrackField`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/world/TrackField.java)) —
  the other kind of path. Walking wears a faint pathway into the ground behind
  you, and behind everybody else in the party, and the wood takes it back after
  **ten minutes**. It is what answers "have I already swept this hollow", "which
  way did they go" and "how do I get back to the lake", without any of them
  being a map. Ground two people crossed comes out darker than ground one did,
  so a route the party keeps using looks like one. It is drawn *on* the terrain
  and never cut into it — the heightfield is what every machine agrees about
  without being told, and a decoration does not get to break that — and nothing
  about it travels: everybody's feet are already in every snapshot, so both ends
  work out the same trail from the same stream.
- **Grass of varying lengths**
  ([`GrassField`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/world/GrassField.java)) —
  every biome has its own band, from cropped tundra to waist-high prairie, and
  the blades sway on a wind field.
- **Water** at height zero, with shallows, shores and fish in it — and a
  **floor you can walk on**. Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> in the water and you sink;
  hold <kbd>Space</kbd> and you rise. Down there the world goes the colour of the
  water and the view closes to a few metres, and your breath spends itself over
  about forty seconds and then floats you back up. It does not kill you: this is
  a game about looking at things, and the worst that should happen to somebody
  who looked too long is having to surface. A submerged player also gets the
  spawn ring sampled *in the water* and offered the biome's swimmers first,
  which is what makes a lake bed somewhere to go rather than somewhere empty.
- **Boats**, drawn up on shorelines
  ([`Boats`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Boats.java)) — generated the
  way the trails are, as a pure function of position and seed, so they are
  genuinely *found*: they are on that beach before anybody has been there, and
  every player in a party finds the same ones without exchanging a byte. Nine
  and a half metres a second against a swimmer's two and a half. Where you leave
  one is where everybody finds it afterwards, which is the only piece of a boat
  that has to be state.
- **Weather**
  ([`Weather`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Weather.java)) — clear,
  cloudy, drizzle, rain, storm, snow, fog and wind, rolled against the biome's
  own climate so it does not snow in the tropics and it rains a great deal in a
  rainforest. It is a **mechanic and not a filter**: each condition carries how
  much is out, how close it lets you get and how far you can see, so a drizzle
  brings the ground feeders out, a storm empties the sky, and **fog is the best
  watching in the game** — the one hour a shy species will let you within twenty
  metres. Like the clock, the host owns it, so a party shares one sky.

### Trees that grow, and cross

**Thirty-six species**
([`TreeSpecies`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/world/TreeSpecies.java)),
of which twenty-four grow wild and **twelve exist only as the child of two
others**. Every tree passes through five stages — seedling, sapling, young,
mature, ancient — and growth is measured in **real hours**, so a tree you plant
on Tuesday is taller on Thursday whether or not the game was running. (The save stamps the wall clock; reopening it
advances everything by the hours that passed.)

Two mature trees within nine metres can be **cross-pollinated**, and the child
carries a genome — vigour, canopy, hue, fruitfulness — mixed from both parents,
so a line improved over five generations plants better than one bought off the
shelf. Six crosses are first-generation; **six more need a hybrid parent**,
which puts the last of them three generations from anything you can find
growing:

```
first generation                     needs a hybrid parent
  Pine   × Birch    → Silver Pine        Birch    × Silver Pine → Ghost Birch
  Oak    × Amethyst → Amethyst Oak       Glowcap  × Glass Fir   → Starcap
  Maple  × Amethyst → Blood Maple        Cedar    × Blood Maple → Dawn Cedar
  Acacia × Redwood  → Emberwood          Palm     × Amethyst Oak → Moonpalm
  …six in all                            …six in all
```

### The animals

**1323 species**, built from **26 families × 7 lineages × 7 epithets**
([`AnimalRegistry`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/life/AnimalRegistry.java)),
each deterministic from its own name — every machine has the same book. A
species carries its family's build and motion, its own three colours, a body
length, a diet, an activity window, a wariness, a rarity tier and the biomes it
lives in.

- **Rarity** runs Common → Uncommon → Scarce → Rare → Legendary (45 / 28 / 17 /
  8 / 2%), and scales both how often something turns up and how far off it
  flushes.
- **Some can be kept as pets.** Feed a tameable species from a feeder enough
  times and it follows you home and goes in the book as yours.
- Animals live in a ring around the party — spawned between 22 m and 95 m,
  simulated while anybody is near, forgotten past 170 m. A world with no edge
  cannot hold a population, and one chaffinch is not tellable from another.
- **A flushed animal keeps going until it is clear.** Fleeing picks a fresh
  escape whenever it reaches the last one, so being walked at moves an animal
  right out of the area rather than fifty metres and no further — and the
  direction is the calmest point on a sampled ring, so it is away from *you*
  (and away from both of you, if there are two of you) rather than away from
  wherever it happened to be facing. A blocked step is deflected by up to
  eighty degrees rather than refused, so an animal runs *along* a shoreline
  instead of pressing into it, and one that is genuinely cornered stands and
  watches instead. Finally, the pose is checked against the ground actually
  covered: nothing is ever drawn running while standing still, whatever the
  reason.
- **They stay in the half of the world they belong to.** A wander target is
  chosen in the animal's own medium and a step that would leave it is refused,
  so a fish does not swim up a hillside and a fox does not wade into a lake —
  with an escape clause, because an animal *already* out of its medium may
  always move back toward it, or the fix for one stuck case would create
  another. Journeys also **time out**: the decision loop used to have no way out
  of "wandering and not there yet", so anything that could not close the
  distance wandered at it for the rest of the session, moving purposefully and
  never arriving. Swimmers measure their depth down from the surface rather than
  up from the bed, which is what stops a fish sitting inside the ground it is
  over.

**Stillness is the stat.** An animal judges you by an *apparent* distance that
your own movement multiplies: standing still for nine seconds makes you seem
far away, crouching more so, and running at a bird is the same as being three
times closer to it. That is the entire skill of the game.

**Spot it, and everybody sees it.** Click an animal
(<kbd>Mouse 1</kbd>) and it is outlined for the whole party for four seconds,
labelled with the species and who found it — the brief's headline verb, and
the thing that makes walking together different from walking alone. A species
nobody has recorded before is a **discovery**: it goes into the shared field
guide, for everyone, with your name on the first sighting.

### Bringing them in

You do not chase things. You give them a reason to come.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Forage** | Berries, seeds, nuts, mushrooms, sap, branches, stones — picked off the bushes and trees the world scattered, and **picked up off the ground it scattered them on**. Everything a region can give you is lying there to be walked to: a fallen branch under the oaks, quartz on a shingle bank, sand on a dune ([`Litter`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Litter.java)). |
| **Fish** | Cast into a lake, wait, and strike inside the bite window. Different waters hold different fish. |
| **Cultivate** | Plant seed and it grows into a crop, or into a tree if it was a tree's seed. |
| **Cook** | Nineteen recipes across bare hands (9), a fire (5) and a bench (5) — suet cake, grain loaf, berry mash, nectar and smoked fish for the animals, and the rod, the trowel, the feeder itself, planks, thatch, rope, a ground lens and the spyglass for you. Cooking outdraws foraging for most appetites, though a kingfisher would still rather have a live trout. |
| **Feed** | Put a filled feeder down and the species whose diet matches come to it. A feeder holds several servings and the food spoils if you leave it out. |

### The spyglass

A draw tube with three stops — **×4, ×8, ×15** — held up on <kbd>Mouse 2</kbd>,
its stop changed with the wheel
([`Spyglass`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Spyglass.java)).

**It physically zooms.** The easy version of this scales the middle of a
finished frame up, which is a magnifying glass held over a photograph: a
chaffinch four hundred metres away stays the three grey pixels it was, only
larger. Instead the camera's own field of view narrows —
`fov = 2·atan(tan(fov₀/2) / power)`, the ratio a real objective and eyepiece
obey — so the far hillside is re-projected at the size it now subtends and
drawn with the triangles it deserves at that size. `EyeCamera`'s floor moved
from 20° to 2° to allow it; 20° is ×3.5, which would have silently clamped the
top two stops and made "×15" a label rather than a claim.

**And the distance is actually built.** A raised glass points the chunk
streamer down a cone, and chunks inside it are wanted far outside the ordinary
view radius, at a level of detail taken from their distance **divided by the
magnification** — at ×8, a chunk twenty out is meshed as though it were two and
a half away, with real trunks and bushes on it rather than a green smear. It
pays for itself: a ×8 glass is a ten-degree frustum, so almost everything in
the ordinary ring is culled before it is ever submitted, and the cone is a
wedge of a circle whose whole area would be thousands of chunks. On a machine
with no card the cone is shorter, for the same reason the ordinary ring is six
chunks there and sixteen on a card.

Three things follow, and they are what separate an instrument from a prop:

- **There is something out there to look at.** A third of a glassing player's
  share of the animal roster is spawned down the line they are looking, and
  nothing inside the cone is despawned while they are watching it. The spawn
  ring is ninety-five metres and a ×15 spot is nine hundred; without this the
  beautifully-drawn far shore would be empty.
- **The host decides the reach.** Its range grows with the power and its
  angular tolerance *shrinks* by it, so glassing is a longer and a more exact
  way of pointing — you pick one bird out of the flock. The server refuses a
  power to anybody without a spyglass in their satchel, because being able to
  write down a bird nine hundred metres away is the one thing in this game
  worth cheating for.
- **It shakes.** Fifteen magnifications multiply the tremor in your hands by
  fifteen too. The sway is scaled to the field of view and damped by the same
  **stillness** stat the whole game already turns on, so crouching and standing
  still is what steadies it, and a readout under the eyepiece says so.

Making one is deliberately the deepest chain in the book: **quartz** off bare
rock or crystal ground and **sand** off a dune or a beach, ground together into
a **lens** at a bench, then two lenses, a plank, rope and sap into the tube.
What the ground gives up is decided by the *surface underfoot* and not merely
the biome you are standing in, so "go and find a beach" is a real instruction —
nobody has a glass in their first ten minutes, and wanting one is a reason to
walk somewhere new.

### Houses

**You buy them, complete.** <kbd>B</kbd> opens a catalogue of ten houses priced
in the same points a keeper's shelf takes — from a 45-point lean-to to a
3400-point mansion — and the one you pick goes up in front of you, facing you,
finished
([`HousePlan`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/home/HousePlan.java)).
<kbd>X</kbd> turns it an eighth at a time before you buy; ← or → takes down the
one you are standing in, for half of what it cost.

**Size and intricacy scale with the price, and they scale structurally.** Each
step up the ladder buys more ground, another floor, a roof with more sides to
it, and then a class of thing the tier below did not have at all: shutters and a
hearth, then glazed windows and a *staircase* and furniture and a chimney, then
a balcony over the front door and a wall to pin maps to, and at the top a house
that stops being one box and grows two wings and a tower. A mansion is 370
boxes of carpentry against a lean-to's 37
([`HouseKit`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/home/HouseKit.java)).

**They are places, not pictures.** The list of boxes the renderer draws is the
same list the walk collides with, so a wall you can see is a wall you cannot
walk through, a floor is what you are standing on, a stair tread is a floor
twenty centimetres up, and a ladder is something you climb with the two keys
that already mean up and down. Walk off a balcony and you fall
([`Homestead`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/home/Homestead.java)).

**Four of the ten go up a tree**, and each comes with the ladder from the ground
to a railed landing at its own back door — because a treehouse you have to
build your own way into is the thing this replaced.

The ground has to be dry and must not fall away too far, but it does **not**
have to be level: the floor is laid at the highest ground under the footprint
and the house stands on piers reaching down to the rest, with the front steps
carried on down beside them.

This replaced building outright. What was there before was ten boxes and a grid,
and the honest thing to say about it is that a wall was one 2.6 m box that could
not have a window in it, a staircase was not expressible at all, and none of it
collided with anything — you walked through your own hide to get into it.

### The day

**Real-life synchronised.** The sun follows the clock on your wall — noon is
noon — and it decides the light, the sky, the fog, the tint on everything and
which animals are out. Night has a deliberate floor: this is a game about
identifying an animal by looking at it, and true darkness would be a game you
cannot play between dusk and dawn. In a hosted walk everyone runs on **the
host's clock**, so a party spread over three time zones is out at the same
hour.

### Firelight

The other half of the night: **four things that burn**, and on a card every one
of them is lit per fragment
([`watch/light`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/light),
[`MeshPass.setLighting`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/MeshPass.java)).

| | Reach | Burns | Fed with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Campfire** — built where it stands, out of three branches and two stones | 12 m | 4 h | branches |
| **Lantern** — carried lit, or set down as a mark | 9 m | 9 h | sap |
| **Torch** — cheap, bright, and gone when it is out | 6.5 m | 1.2 h | — |
| **Spore Lantern** — cold green, from the mushroom hollow, never goes out | 7.5 m | for ever | — |

<kbd>N</kbd> lights, douses or fills whatever is in your hand; <kbd>H</kbd> sets
it down, or builds a fire when your hands are empty; <kbd>E</kbd> at one feeds
it, lights it, or picks it back up still burning. Fuel runs on the **wall
clock** like the trees do, so a fire lit before bed is out in the morning.
Everybody sees everybody's lantern, which is how a party keeps track of each
other after dark.

**The three things that hunt you light the ground now** — each in its own glow
colour, on a slow heartbeat, and deliberately only six metres of it: a wendigo
that lit the wood like a campfire would make meeting one well lit, which is the
wrong feeling entirely.

None of the lighting travels: a fire's *existence* is replicated and every
consequence of it is worked out on the machine drawing it. Up to sixteen lights
a frame, ranked by how much lit ground each can put in front of the camera, so
a camp of forty lanterns costs what sixteen do. The card derives the surface
normal it needs from the depth gradient (`cross(dFdx, dFdy)`) rather than from a
vertex attribute, so **no geometry is re-uploaded when a light moves** — which is
what makes a carried lantern affordable at all. The Java2D path draws the same
model per triangle, off the face's own normal, against lights culled per mesh.
See [WATCH_PLAN §7j](WATCH_PLAN.md).

### What a graphics card does with all that

A flat multiplier is a complete answer to *what time is it* and no answer at all
to *what does it look like out*. So the hour is also handed to the backend as a
**description of the sky** rather than a number
([`SkyLight`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/light/SkyLight.java),
[`MeshPass.Sky`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/MeshPass.java)) —
where the sun is and what colour, what the sky above and the ground below give
back, how thick the air is and where the mist is lying — and the GL backend
spends real work on it:

- **A sun in the sky the clock actually put it in.** Orange on the horizon,
  pale overhead, cold and blue when it is the moon; against a two-colour
  ambient, the sky's own colour on what faces up and a dim bounce on what faces
  down. One `mix` per fragment, and it is most of the difference between
  low-poly ground that reads as carved and low-poly ground that reads as a
  sheet of green.
- **Trees cast shadows** — a depth map from the sun
  ([`GlShadowMap`](gl/src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/gl/GlShadowMap.java)),
  alpha-tested against the same atlas so a canopy throws *dapple* rather than
  the shadow of a box, snapped to whole texels so it does not crawl as you
  walk, and faded at its rim so there is no line ruled across the wood. Not
  drawn at all at night, under a storm or under water, where nothing would see
  it.
- **…and so does a campfire, after dark** — a cube depth map from the brightest
  lamp near you
  ([`GlLampShadow`](gl/src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/gl/GlLampShadow.java)),
  which is the half the sun cannot do. Sunlight is parallel, so a tree's shadow
  is the width of the tree; a fire is a *point*, so the same tree throws a
  shadow that **spreads as it goes** and reaches the far side of the clearing.
  One lamp gets the map, only what stands inside its twelve metres casts into
  it, each caster is drawn into only the faces it is actually in, and the whole
  thing is then kept for as long as you sit there — a fire does not move and
  neither does a wood. It costs nothing in daylight, where it would not be seen,
  and it ramps in through dusk rather than switching on.
- **Fires and lanterns light the air**, not only the ground. The point-light
  loop already knows where each lamp is; one more dot product gives how close
  it passes to the *view ray* and how much of that ray lies inside its reach,
  which is the broad cone of glow round a fire in a damp wood.
- **Fog with a height to it.** Mist pools in the hollows and a ridge stands out
  of it, the bank drifts rather than sitting still, and it is bright toward the
  sun and not away from it. A campfire in a fog bank lights the fog.
- **One knob of grade** at the end: saturation, and a knee that rolls the
  highlights off so the middle of a lantern's pool keeps the lantern's colour
  instead of clipping to white. It backs off exactly as far as the weather
  comes on, because a storm is meant to look like a storm.

Lamps are **culled per mesh** and drawn near-to-far, so a campfire costs the
part of the screen it actually lights rather than all of it; the glow it puts
in the air is rationed to the eight lamps that fill most of the view, since
that is the one term standing inside a light makes global. The shadow pass is
drawn **once and then kept**: a shadow map is a function of where
its box is and what stands in it, and a player who is not walking has moved
neither — so standing still costs it nothing at all, and walking costs about a
fifth of what it did. The fire's cube is cached the same way and against the
same two questions, with one wrinkle worth the sentence: a flame's radius
*flickers every frame*, so the reach is compared loosely and the map's far plane
set beyond it — compared exactly, a campfire would never once reuse its own map.
`-Dlarsons.render.gl.shadowmap=N` sets the sun map's edge in texels and
`-Dlarsons.render.gl.lampshadow=N` a cube face's; `0` skips either, and `0` on
the first skips both. See
[WATCH_PLAN §7l](WATCH_PLAN.md) for the measurements. **The Java2D path is untouched by every line of this**: both
backends still agree on the hour, the fog's colour and range and every lamp,
and they differ only in how richly the same described world is drawn. A
directional term on the painter would cost a normal for every triangle in the
frame rather than only the ones near a flame, on the thread that is also
running the game.

### What everything is made of

All of the above is about the *light*. None of it says what a surface **does**
with the light, which is the difference between a world of coloured card and a
world of things: water and wet stone and a beetle's shell are all "shiny" in a
way no diffuse term can express at all — the highlight moves with your eye
rather than with the surface, and it is the strongest single cue that a thing is
made of something.

So every material
([`WatchMaterial`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/world/WatchMaterial.java))
now carries the standard metal/roughness pair and how deep its own bumps are,
and [`WatchMaterials`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/world/WatchMaterials.java)
bakes a **second atlas** beside the colour one — a tangent-space normal in red
and green, roughness in blue, metalness in alpha, tile for tile and addressed by
the same texture coordinates. The GL backend evaluates a real microfacet
material against it (GGX, height-correlated Smith, Schlick) for the sun, for
every lamp that touches the mesh, and for the sky itself:

- **The lake holds the sky.** The ambient hemisphere sampled a second time along
  the *reflected* ray, weighted by a Fresnel that opens at grazing angles and
  closes as a surface roughens, and tinted by the horizon's own colour. Water is
  dark where you look into it and bright where you look across it, and pink at
  dawn — and what the reflection takes, the water underneath does not get, so a
  see-through surface goes *opaque* exactly where it goes mirrored.
- **Relief without a single extra byte per vertex.** The same screen-space
  gradients that already give a face its normal give the tangent frame to
  perturb it in, so gravel is rubble and bark is grooves and neither costs
  anything to upload. Where a mesh gives all three vertices one texture
  coordinate — every animal, plank and leaf in this game — there is no frame to
  build and the face's own normal is used, which is right for a flat-shaded
  facet.
- **It fades out before it can sparkle.** A fragment measures how many texels of
  the normal map it covers; past one, what the screen can no longer resolve is
  handed to the roughness instead of sampled as noise. A hillside two hundred
  metres off is a soft sheen rather than a field of fireflies.
- **Tiles that do not read as tiles.** A tile is stretched across one two-metre
  quad, so the ground would otherwise be the same stamp to the horizon. A slow
  world-space drift over tens of metres breaks it up for four transcendentals
  and no texture fetch, at frequencies that are exact multiples of the world's
  own coordinate fold so there is no seam.
- **A grade that lifts colour rather than adding it.** The vibrance knob is a
  *vibrance* now: the lift is largest on the colours that have least, so moss,
  lichen and a shaded hillside come up while a fox and a rowan berry are left
  where they were.

And one bug, which is most of why the GL build never looked as good as it should
have. Every mesher bakes a material's **colour** into the vertex, because the
Java2D painter fills a flat polygon with that colour and never samples a texture
at all; the card shades a fragment as `texture × vertexColour`. While the atlas
held colours too, the card was multiplying the colour by itself — grass the
painter fills at `547E37` came off the shader at `1D400C`, a third as bright and
most of the way to black, *for every surface in the game*. The colour atlas now
holds each tile **divided by its own average**, so a texel means "this much
brighter or darker than this material" and `detail × colour × light` is the
painter's own answer with the texture on top. Both backends draw the same world
again, and the GL one is no longer drawing it through a filter.

None of this reaches the Java2D build, on the same terms as everything else in
this section: a specular lobe per light per *triangle* on the thread that is
also running the game is not a trade worth making, and the painter keeps the
flat fill it can afford.

### The book

<kbd>G</kbd> opens the field guide
([`WatchGuideScene`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/WatchGuideScene.java)),
sortable five ways — recently found, by family, where you are, by rarity, still
missing. A page you have written shows the species' **actual model**, three
quarters on, with where and when you saw it and who found it; a page you have
not shows a silhouette, the family, and where to look — which is exactly the
amount of information that sends somebody out of the door. Three bars along the
bottom say how much of that family, that rarity tier and that biome is still
blank.

### Trading posts, and the page a keeper stamps

Points used to be a sum over the entries in your book — which meant they could
never be *spent* (spending would mean deleting entries, and a guide does not
delete entries) and a species already in the book was worth nothing for ever.
Both halves are now fixed by keeping two things where the book kept one: the
**record**, which is permanent, and the **page**, which is the set of species
already scored *since the last time a page was turned*.

**Trading posts** are where a page gets turned
([`Shops`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Shops.java)). They are
generated the way the trails and the boats are — a pure function of position and
seed — so they are genuinely *found*: about one every 1.3 km², always beside a
trail on flat dry ground, with the counter facing the road. Nothing about one
ever crosses the wire, because nothing about one can be changed.

Walk up to a counter and <kbd>E</kbd> opens the shop:

- **Buy materials with points.** Branches, bark, reeds, stone, vine, clay, sap,
  planks, thatch, rope, sand, quartz, a ground lens — plus a feeder, a trowel or
  a rod, and something to put on the feeder. Each keeper carries six to nine
  lines chosen by their own hash and weighted by the country they stand in, at
  their own markup, so two posts a valley apart are worth comparing. Nobody
  sells a **spyglass**: the two-step grind at a bench is still the only way to
  get one.
- **Have a fresh page stamped.** The tally empties, the old page is filed as a
  numbered volume with its date and the keeper's name on it, and **every animal
  you have ever seen is worth its rarity again** — while every one of them stays
  in the guide. A keeper will not stamp a blank page, which is what keeps the
  loop "go and find things, then come back" rather than "spot, stamp, spot,
  stamp" at one chaffinch.

The crosshair is where you find out: over an animal it now says *"Something
new"*, *"worth 8 points"*, or *"click to point it out"* — and the middle one is
what a stamped page buys you.

The keeper is a **character**, not a shop front
([`KeeperModel`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/render/KeeperModel.java)):
a name, a trade, a line they say when you walk up, a coat with facings and an
apron, one of three hats, sometimes a beard and sometimes spectacles, and often
a small tame animal from their own biome sitting on the counter — all derived
from the post's id, so they look and sound the same next week. They breathe,
shift their weight, lean in to write in the ledger every thirteen seconds or so,
and **turn their head to look at whoever walks up**. The post itself is a
carpentry drawing rather than a box
([`ShopModel`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/render/ShopModel.java)):
stone footings, a plank deck with a step, corner posts and plate beams, a
pitched roof on real rafters, a swinging sign, a counter with a ledger and a set
of scales on it, and a yard with a woodpile, crates, a barrel and a hitching
rail. **The wares on the back shelves are that post's actual stock**, drawn with
the same models the satchel uses, so you can read what a keeper sells before
opening anything.

### Two games inside the game

Everything else in the Field Guide is something one person does. These two are
things one person does *to everybody else*, which is why one of them has a vote
in front of it and the other has a limit of one a day.

**Tag** ([`Tag`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Tag.java)). Press
<kbd>T</kbd> and the party is asked. It carries on a **strict majority of the
walk, not of the votes cast** — an abstention is a no, or two people out of eight
could start a chase while the other six were looking through spyglasses — and the
poll closes the moment its answer can no longer change rather than sitting there
for half a minute. Whoever asked is **it**, which is what stops "let's play tag"
being a way of making somebody else run around for half an hour.

Being it means three things: **1.3× speed**, a **water gun** that tags at range,
and **thirty seconds of standing still** every time it changes hands — the count
of the playground game, which scatters the field and makes tagging back the
person who just tagged you impossible. The freeze is enforced by the host
*refusing to write down where you say you are*, because a client is the authority
on its own position and there is no other way to hold somebody still; your head
still turns while it lasts, and watching everybody scatter is most of what those
thirty seconds are for.

Whoever is it also gets the **compass the chase needs**: a needle on the ordinary
compass strip pointing at the nearest walker, with the distance. Only they see
it — given to everybody it would end every round in about forty seconds, as the
field spread out along the vectors they were shown — and nothing about it
travels, because everybody's position is already in every snapshot.

<kbd>T</kbd> again, during a round, asks the party to call it off. One key, one
mechanism, and no way for whoever is losing to stop the game on their own. The
round keeps running while the question is being asked.

**Eye Spy** ([`Bounty`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Bounty.java)).
<kbd>J</kbd> opens a board of animals that live where you are standing — the ones
already in the book first — and pins one up as a bounty for the rest of the party
to find. **The world prices it**, at somewhere between 10 and 100 points, chosen
at random: a reward you set yourself is a reward you set to a hundred every time.
**One a day, per walker**, on the real calendar, because a bounty should be a
thing you thought about. And **whoever asked cannot answer it** — the next person
to spot one claims it, their name goes on the posting, and the points go into the
shared book like every other point in this game. Unclaimed bounties come down
after a day, so the board is a list of things worth doing this week rather than
an archive of everything anybody ever wondered about.

### One seed, no terrain on the wire

The server owns one
[`WatchGame`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/WatchGame.java) and clients
own none, exactly as the auto battler and the world server do. What crosses the
wire is only what cannot be derived: where people are, what is alive near them,
who spotted what, and the guide they are filling in together — no terrain, no
tree, no blade of grass. A client is told the seed once and generates the same
hillside the host is standing on.

The **field guide is shared** and your **satchel is not**. Positions round to
the centimetre; the tick rate is 20 Hz; a ninth player is turned away with a
reason rather than dropped.

### GPU and threads

Chunks are 32 m square, generated and meshed on a pool of background workers
([`ChunkStreamer`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/world/ChunkStreamer.java)),
nearest first, at a level of detail that falls off with distance — which is
what the pure-function generator buys: any chunk, on any thread, in any order,
byte-identical every time. A raised **spyglass** adds a second, much longer
ring: a cone down the line of sight whose chunks are built at a detail chosen
from their distance *divided by the magnification*, which is how a distant
hillside seen through a glass is the same ground the near one is rather than a
coarse impostor of it.

**Ground that has been built stays built.** A chunk walked away from moves into
a least-recently-used cache sized from the heap this JVM was given
([`ChunkMemory`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/ChunkMemory.java) — an
eighth of it, at 96 KB a chunk, floored at 256 and capped at 12,288), and
walking back into it is a map lookup rather than a regeneration. Before this,
anything past the view radius was simply dropped: walking to the lake and back
rebuilt the whole path there, on the very workers that should have been building
the ground *ahead*, and pacing over one chunk boundary could regenerate the same
ground indefinitely. On a machine with sixteen gigabytes in it, throwing that
work away to save forty megabytes is the wrong trade by two orders of magnitude.
The cache is only ever an optimisation — a chunk is a pure function of
`(seed, x, y)`, so a miss is indistinguishable from a cache that was never there
— which is why a small heap can have a small one and nothing else has to know.

Drawing goes through one backend-neutral seam
([`MeshPass`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/MeshPass.java)). On the
**OpenGL** backend a mesh becomes a VBO cached by identity and revision and the
card does the projection, the clipping and the shading. On the **Java2D**
backend the same triangles go through a painter's algorithm with no
per-frame allocation. A texture pack recolours the first and fully textures the
second from one set of files.

Two things about that cache were quietly wrong, and both cost frames rather than
correctness — which is why they lasted:

- **A buffer is only re-usable at the origin it was filled at.** Vertices are
  measured from their mesh's origin and the origin is applied by the matrix, so
  when `GlMeshPass` deferred an upload past its per-frame cap it drew last
  frame's vertices at this frame's origin. The dynamic mesh — animals, walkers,
  feeders, everything built — is rebuilt each frame around the *player*, so the
  whole lot shifted by however far you had walked and snapped back on the next
  upload. Walls and platforms, which do not move at all, were where it showed.
  Buffers now record their origin and a moved one is never deferred.
- **Level of detail never reached the card.** The meshers stamped the chunk's
  *data* revision — fixed at generation — into every mesh, and that is exactly
  the number the backend compares to decide whether to re-upload. So a chunk
  re-meshed at a finer LOD produced meshes the backend had already seen and
  skipped: on the GPU path a chunk was drawn for ever at whatever detail it was
  first built at, and walking toward a hillside never sharpened it. There is now
  a mesh revision distinct from the data revision.

The per-frame upload cap went from twelve to thirty-six at the same time. Twelve
was chosen when a view held a few dozen chunks; at the distances a card actually
holds, it turned "the ground arrives a frame late" into "the ground arrives four
seconds late", with the world visibly assembling itself ahead of a walking
player.

### You, and what you are holding

There is a **person** in this game and you can see them
([`WalkerModel`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/render/WalkerModel.java)):
one articulated figure — legs that swing, arms that swing against them, a hat
brim that reads at two hundred metres and a coat colour picked from your player
id so eight people in one wood are eight people. It is drawn for everybody,
including you in third person, sitting lower in the water and lower again on a
thwart. In **first person** the same model supplies **hands**, built in the
camera's own basis so they follow the view exactly, with a reach gesture when
you pick something and whatever you are carrying in the right one.

Everything you can pick up has a **model** too
([`ItemModel`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/render/ItemModel.java)) —
one per kind, tinted per item — so a feeder shows what it was filled with from
across a clearing, which matters because that is what decides what turns up at
it.

### One key for the thing in front of you

Picking a bush, pulling a ripe crop, topping up a feeder and taking the oars
used to be four keys, three of which failed silently at each other's targets —
and you had no way of knowing which of the four you were standing at except by
trying all of them. Now <kbd>E</kbd> does whatever is in reach, the thing itself
**glows** — a soft halo, a ring and four corner ticks — and a line under it says
what would happen ([`WatchGame.pickTarget`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/WatchGame.java)).
What you picked up flashes under the crosshair rather than scrolling past in the
chat log.

**Everything that glows is a real object.** Every one of the hundred-odd things
in [`Forage`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Forage.java) has a solid of
its own — an acorn has a cap, a pine cone has scales, a beetle has legs, a
bottle of nectar has a neck and a stopper
([`ItemModel`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/render/ItemModel.java)) —
drawn wherever that item is: on a feeder's tray, in a hand, on the ground, and
beside its own row in the satchel.

The satchel screen is **two scrolling columns** — what you are carrying and what
you could cook — with cursors, windows and bars. (It could not be scrolled at
all before: the list drew until it ran out of panel and then stopped, so a
satchel after an hour had a tail nobody could see.) Every row carries **a
picture of the thing itself** — its own model, rendered three-quarters on
([`ItemPortrait`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/render/ItemPortrait.java)),
with a larger one along the footer of whichever row the cursor is on.

It is **worked entirely with the mouse or entirely with the keys**. Hovering a
row selects it, clicking does what <kbd>Enter</kbd> does to it — make the
recipe, plant the seed, put the food out — the wheel scrolls whichever column
the pointer is over, the bars drag, and there is a ✕. The arrow keys still do
all of it, and a pointer resting on the desk does not drag the cursor back to
the row under it. A **compass** strip and a **breath meter** round it out; the
breath only appears when you are spending it.

### Controls

<kbd>WASD</kbd> walks and the mouse looks. <kbd>Space</kbd> **jumps** on land and
**rises** in water; <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> toggles the crouch on land and **sinks** in
water — up is up and crouch is down, as in every game with swimming in it.
<kbd>Shift</kbd> sprints. A jump clears about eighty centimetres, which is a
boulder or a fallen trunk, and there is no fall damage: this is still a game
about looking at things.
<kbd>F5</kbd> goes third person. <kbd>Mouse 1</kbd> spots what you are looking
at, <kbd>Mouse 2</kbd> (or <kbd>Z</kbd>) holds the spyglass up — the wheel
changes its stop while it is up — <kbd>E</kbd> does whatever is in reach,
<kbd>G</kbd> opens the book,
<kbd>Tab</kbd> the satchel, <kbd>F</kbd> puts down a feeder, <kbd>R</kbd>
plants, <kbd>C</kbd> cross-pollinates, <kbd>Y</kbd> boards and leaves a boat,
<kbd>B</kbd> opens the house catalogue, <kbd>X</kbd> turns the house you have
picked, <kbd>V</kbd> casts and
strikes, <kbd>N</kbd> lights, douses or fills whatever is in your hand,
<kbd>H</kbd> sets a light down — or builds a campfire, when your hands are
empty — <kbd>M</kbd> draws a map (debug mode only, for now — see below),
<kbd>L</kbd> leaves. <kbd>T</kbd> suggests a game of tag, calls one off, or
votes yes; <kbd>U</kbd> votes no; <kbd>Q</kbd> is the water gun while you are it;
<kbd>J</kbd> opens the Eye Spy board. All rebindable from **Controls (Key
Binds)** in the walk's own lobby, which shows this game's keys rather than the
engine's.

### Maps (debug mode only, for now)

Press <kbd>M</kbd> and you have a map of the country you are standing in. It
goes in your satchel, it opens when you click it, you can write on it with a
pen, and it shows where everybody is — including the ones who have walked off
the edge of it. Buy a house with a **map board** on its study wall and several
of them join into one larger map that the whole party can read.

The whole feature is behind
[debug mode](#debug-mode-type-7799) while it is being finished; everything
below already works, and what has not been decided is what a map should cost a
player who is not in debug mode.

**A map is as wide as you can see.** Its size comes from the render distance of
the machine that drew it — a card with a long ring draws a map twice the width
of one drawn on a laptop painting through Java2D — and wherever you were
standing when you pressed the key, everything inside your view is inside the
square. The sizes come off a ladder of doublings and the centre snaps to the
grid that size defines, which is what makes two maps meet edge to edge instead
of a hand's width apart.

**It arrives finished.** There is no fog to walk off. The ground in this world
is a pure function of the seed, so the paper is painted from the seed the
moment the map exists
([`ChartImage`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/render/ChartImage.java)) —
relief-shaded, with the water darkening by depth and the trails drawn in. The
icons are collected at that same moment
([`Survey`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Survey.java)): trading posts,
houses, feeders, plantings, boats, the places species were first recorded, and
the high ground read off the heightfield itself. A house is one icon, named for
what it is.

Which means a map **ages**. The post is on it for ever because a post cannot
move; the feeder you had out that morning stays on it long after it rotted; the
house you buy next week is not on it at all. That is the difference between a
map and a minimap, and it is the only reason to ever draw a second map of the
same place.

**Write on it.** Four tools down the side — a pen in six inks, a note, an
eraser and a hand — with the wheel to zoom and the right button to move the
paper. A pen stroke is one line, one thing to rub out and one thing your name is
on; a note is a few words pinned at a point, which is where the information
actually goes ("otters, dusk"). Ink is stored in **world metres**, not as a
fraction of the paper, so a line you drew near one map's edge is in the same
space as the line on the map next to it.

**It shows everybody, on it or off it.** Every walker gets a pin, turned to
face the way they are looking. Somebody who has walked off the paper is pinned
to the border with a smaller arrow pointing after them and how far away they
are — the Minecraft rule, and the one that makes a map useful to a party rather
than to a person.

**Rename it in the satchel.** Maps sit at the top of the carrying column, each
with a thumbnail of itself for an icon. <kbd>Enter</kbd> or a click opens one;
<kbd>F2</kbd> renames it, with the old name selected so the first character you
type replaces it.

**A map board joins them up.** Every house from the lodge up has one on its
study wall ([Houses](#houses)); stand at it and press <kbd>E</kbd>. Maps in your satchel are listed to the right; click one
and it goes up. The board's paper is the union of everything pinned to it, with
each map drawn where it actually is — so pinning a second map of the next
valley simply makes the board bigger, with **no join to line up, no orientation
to choose and no order to get right.** Two maps of the same size drawn a span
apart meet exactly; a detailed map of one corner nests inside the overview it
belongs to, because the sizes are doublings. Click a pinned map to take it back
down, and your annotations come with it.

**And you can see it without opening anything.** The combined map is painted
onto both faces of the board itself, as a grid of little flat facets in the
colours of the ground they stand for — the same low-poly language the terrain
is drawn in, so a map on a board looks like it belongs to this world rather
than like a photograph hung in it
([`BoardImage`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/render/BoardImage.java)).
Walk past and you can see how much country the party has surveyed, where the
camps and the posts are, and what somebody circled in red; a pen stroke appears
on the timber on the frame the ink lands, so drawing on a map is something the
rest of the party watches happen from across the clearing. Both faces, because
a board is built facing whichever way its builder happened to be looking.
Opening it is for the small print — a note's words, a map's name, which sheet
is which — and seeing it is not gated on debug mode: the mode withholds the
*making* of maps, not the sight of one.

**Nothing about a map ever travels as a picture.** A map on the wire and in the
save is a centre, a radius, a name and whatever somebody drew on it
([`Chart`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Chart.java)); both ends paint
the identical paper from the seed they already share. That is the same argument
the trading posts make for not being sent, and it is why two players' copies of
one map agree pixel for pixel — and why the join on a board is invisible.

### Debug mode (type `7799`)

Type **7 7 9 9** on the number keys anywhere in the walk — the satchel screen
included — and debug mode comes on. Type it again and it goes off. It is not on
the controls screen and it is not on a menu, because a cheat code is not a
control and a menu item is an invitation to press it
([`Debug`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/watch/Debug.java)).

It grants:

- **Unlimited points.** Anything on any keeper's shelf and any house in the
  catalogue, at any price, without spending what the guide earned. The one row
  that had to be added by hand: a trading post's prices — and a house's — come
  out of the book's balance rather than out of a satchel, so the
  bottomless-satchel lens below does not reach them.
- **Unlimited items.** Every recipe, every feeder, every seed and every tool, in
  any number, for ever.
- **[Maps](#maps-debug-mode-only-for-now).** Draw one with <kbd>M</kbd>, mark
  it with a pen, and pin maps together on a board. The odd one out: it grants
  *access* rather than abundance, because the feature is finished and its price
  is not. It is the row that will be deleted rather than becoming free.
- **Summon mutants.** <kbd>K</kbd> puts one of the three in front of you,
  hunting, ignoring the cap and the cooldown — because otherwise testing the
  one thing in the wood that can kill you means waiting for it to find you.
- **Wind the clock.** <kbd>,</kbd> and <kbd>.</kbd> scrub the time of day and
  <kbd>/</kbd> puts it back on the real one. The sun's angle and colour, the
  ambient, whether there is a shadow pass at all, the dawn mist, which animals
  are out and whether a campfire casts — all of it is a function of the hour,
  and all of it was previously testable only by waiting. The host owns the
  clock, so a client scrubbing it scrubs it for the whole party: a debug verb
  that moved the sun on one screen would be a party that no longer agrees what
  time it is.
- **A readout** down the left: position, chunk and level of detail, the biome
  and the material underfoot, what the streamer is holding and queueing, what
  the frame drew and culled, what is alive nearby, the spyglass, the guide.

**The part worth reading about is how the first one works**, because it is the
answer to "it should keep working as the game grows". Debug mode does not hand
out a list of items — a list is a copy of a registry, and it goes stale the
week after it is written. It makes the player's satchel *bottomless*, and every
cost in this game is a `has` and a `take` against a `Satchel`. So an item added
to `Forage` is already unlimited and a recipe added to `Recipes` is already
affordable — with no edit to the debug code at all. The spyglass proved it: it was built before this
mode existed and debug mode granted it without a line.

It is a **lens, not a gift**: what is really in the bag is untouched
underneath, so switching the mode off leaves the walk exactly as it was. The
flag rides in the player's own snapshot, so a client's cooking and house
screens light up exactly when the host says they should, and it survives a save
— a walk played with everything unlimited is that walk when you reopen it.

And it is **the host's walk only**. On your own walk, or one you are hosting,
the code works; on somebody else's it is refused, because the field guide is
shared and a stranger with unlimited suet cake writes their way through a book
four other people are keeping.

When a future feature needs something the bottomless satchel cannot already
give it — a spawn, a teleport, a clock wound forward — the shape is: add a row
to `Debug.Power`, which is what puts it on the readout, and one
`if (player.debugging())` where it acts.

### Bringing your own art

Every animal ships with a generated 64×64 Minecraft-style skin and a boxy
model. Both are placeholders and both are replaceable:

- Drop a Blockbench **`.bbmodel`** into `resources/watch/models/` named after a
  species (`songbird_finch_banded.bbmodel`) or a family
  (`songbird.bbmodel`, which dresses all forty-nine at once) and it is used
  instead — bones bind to joints by name, clips bind to the nine animation
  states by name, and **any state you have not animated falls back to the
  procedural pose**, so art can arrive one clip at a time.
  [`resources/watch/models/README.md`](src/main/resources/watch/models/README.md)
  is the full import guide: axes, units, pivots, the bone-name table, the clip
  table, and how to tell it loaded.
- A texture pack supplying `watch/animal/<species>` or `watch/animal/<family>`
  reskins one or all of them; `watch/terrain/<material>` retextures the ground.
  A model's boxes take their colour from their own region of that sheet, so a
  pack reaches the world and not only the book.
- **A pack can supply the other half of a material too**, and gets some of it
  for free either way. `watch_terrain/grass_normal.png` is a tangent-space
  normal map (flat is `128,128,255`) and `watch_terrain/grass_surface.png` holds
  roughness in red and metalness in green — both optional, both listed in the
  generated `TEXTURE_KEYS.txt`. Supply neither and the engine derives the relief
  from the light in the picture you *did* supply, so dropping in a photograph of
  gravel gets bumps that agree with the gravel in it.

The engine ships no image files. Everything above is drawn at runtime.

## The pause screen

**Esc** during play opens a screen, not a list of buttons. Pausing is the one
moment a player is deliberately *not* playing, and it is when the questions they
cannot ask mid-fight arrive — so the pause screen answers them.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│        [ Quit to Menu ]            └──────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The **actions** are grouped by what you came here to do: get back in, save,
change how it feels, leave. *Save and Quit* is one press, and *Quit to Menu*
asks first when there is unsaved progress. Online, the two save entries are
absent rather than disabled — the server owns that world and there is nothing
here to write.

The **panels** are live, re-read every frame, so an autosave landing while the
menu is open updates the chip and a multiplayer session's ping keeps moving:

- **Save state**, top right — *Saved 2m ago* / *Unsaved changes* / *Saving…*,
  the single most useful thing to know before walking away from the keyboard.
- **The run** — character, ultimate, which physics the level runs and which way
  is up, the hour of the day, how long this run has been played, which slot it
  is in.
- **Vitals** — health, mana, stamina and the ultimate meter as bars with their
  numbers. Pools a character does not have are not drawn.
- **Goals** — the level's [stat rules](#game-types-levels--feature-toggles) with
  live progress: *every* rule, not just the ones whose author ticked "show bar",
  because what crowds the HUD during play is a different question from what a
  paused player is allowed to know. A one-shot that has paid out reads *done*; a
  repeating one counts toward its next step and says how many times it has
  fired.
- **This run** — every non-zero counter, abbreviated (`1.8k`, `96.5k`).
- **Session** (online only) — players, ping, and whether you are hosting.
- **Keys** — the handful of binds people forget, read live from your own
  [key binds](#custom-key-binds-rebind-anything) rather than from a hardcoded
  list, so a rebound key is right here too.

Sub-sheets open **over** the screen rather than replacing it, so changing the
volume or rebinding a key costs neither the level nor the session:
[*Options*](#your-own-settings-volume-sensitivity-hud-size) and *Controls* both
open in place, and **Esc** backs out one layer at a time.

It **degrades rather than breaking**. Below 780px wide the panels are dropped
and the actions take the full width; the right column stops drawing panels when
it runs out of vertical room, so the panel order is also a priority order. Three
golden frames pin the three layouts: `pause-screen` (1280×720, everything),
`pause-screen-narrow` (640×420, one column) and `pause-screen-online`.

Its feature toggles are still edited in *Level Select → Edit Settings* rather than
here. Those belong to the level and outlive the session, and a pause menu that
quietly rewrites the level being played is how this engine used to lose people's
work.


## Saving (runs, slots, and what a save actually is)

A **run** is a play-through of a game type: where you are, what you are
carrying, how you are doing, and **every level you have changed along the way**.
It is a different noun from a *level*, and the distinction is the whole of this
system — the engine could always write a level to disk and read it back, and had
nothing at all that described the person playing it.

### An authored level is a template; a run is a copy

Nothing on the play path writes to `resources/levels/` any more. Play reads the
authored level once, when a run first enters it, and from then on writes only
into the run's own folder:

```
src/main/resources/saves/<game-type>/<slot>/
    run.json              you: character, health/mana/stamina, position,
                          inventory + hotbar, every tracked stat, the stat-rule
                          fire counts per level, the world clock, play time
    levels/<name>.json    the run's own copy of each level it has changed
```

`levels/` is a second **levels root** —
[`LevelStore`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/LevelStore.java) already
took its root as a constructor argument, so a run's copy of a level is written
and read by exactly the code that writes and reads an authored one. No new file
format was needed for the world half of a save; what was missing was somewhere
to put it, and something to mean "this run"
([`RunRecord`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/save/RunRecord.java)).

Because the authored copy stays pristine, **New Run** is a meaningful thing to
offer: it starts from the levels as their author built them. Before this, playing
a level and pressing *Save Level* wrote back over that author's file.

### When it saves

- **Every door.** The level being left is written *before* the destination is
  read. That ordering is the difference between a game type of linked levels
  being one continuous world and being a set of rooms that reset.
- **Every death.** So "I died" never also means "and lost the hour before it".
- **Every couple of minutes**, and only when something has actually happened.
- **Whenever you leave** — *Save and Quit*, *Quit to Menu*, or any other way out
  of the play scene. Quitting with unsaved progress asks first.
- **On demand**, from the pause menu's *Save Run*.

### Why it does not cost a frame

Serializing a level is not free. Measured on a dense level, `toMap()` then
`stringify`:

| level | `toMap()` | `stringify` | total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 256×256 | 1.67 ms | 6.08 ms | 7.7 ms |
| 512×512 | 5.20 ms | 6.68 ms | 11.9 ms |
| 1024×1024 | 33.74 ms | 125.56 ms | 159.3 ms |

A 60 Hz frame is 16.67 ms.
[`RunSession`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/save/RunSession.java) therefore
takes the **snapshot** on the game thread — `toMap()` has to read live state, and
produces a tree of plain maps that shares nothing with the `Level` — and does the
string building and the file write on a single background writer. It also
**skips levels nobody has touched**, using the revision counter `Level` already
keeps, so a periodic autosave for a player who is walking around rather than
building writes only `run.json`. Saves are queued in order rather than
collapsed, and a synchronous save waits its turn rather than being overtaken by
an autosave taken earlier. Writes go through a temporary file and a move, so an
interrupted save leaves either the old run or the new one and never half of
either. The snapshot appears as its own `autosave` stage in the
[frame profiler](#frame-profiler-where-the-time-actually-goes).

### The run owns the stat-rule fire counts

A level's [`StatRule`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/StatRule.java)s are
the level's; how many times each has *fired* is the run's, keyed by level. They
used to belong to the per-level rule engine, which was rebuilt on every entry
while the counters it was measured against carried on across doors — so a
one-shot "mine 50 blocks → take a diamond" paid out again every time the player
walked out of the level and back. Every authored reward in the engine was
farmable. The counts live in `run.json` now and are restored whenever a level is
entered again.

### Online

Runs are offline. In a multiplayer session the server owns the world, and who
owns a save — and what happens to a player's things when they disconnect — is a
genuinely different design that needs the offline run model to exist first. The
play scene holds no run in a session, and every save path there is a no-op.

## Your own settings (volume, sensitivity, HUD size)

Some settings belong to the **person playing** rather than to the game type they
are playing.
[`KeyBinds`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/input/KeyBindStore.java) always
drew that line correctly; audio did not. Volume lived on `GameProfile`, was
captured into every level file, and was copied back out on load — so opening a
level somebody else authored replaced your mix with theirs, and walking through
a door between two levels saved at different volumes changed it mid-run.

[`PlayerSettings`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/config/PlayerSettings.java)
now holds them in `config/player.json`, beside `keybinds.json` and under the same
rules (a missing or unreadable file is the defaults, never an error; it is plain
text you can copy between machines):

| setting | what it does |
|---|---|
| master / effects / music volume | the mix, on *your* machine |
| mouse sensitivity | `[F5]` first- and third-person look speed, 10–500% |
| invert look (Y axis) | for whom an uninvertible Y axis means those views may as well not exist |
| HUD size | 75–300%, for a HUD sized in pixels on a 4K display |
| distant terrain | draw the world past the view distance, coarsely — see below |
| detail distance | how much of the render distance is drawn *block by block* — see below |
| decorations | how far flowers, grass and scenery are drawn — see below |

They are edited from **Options** in the pause menu — the first place in the
engine a player rather than an author can change how the game feels — and from
the creative editor's sound dialog, which now moves *your* volume rather than
the game type's. Whether a level *has* music is still the creator's call, as is
whether sounds drift in pitch; only how loud it all is moved out.

**Distant terrain** is the one that changes the picture rather than the feel,
and it is here rather than on the game type for the same reason as the rest: it
is a statement about the machine in front of you, and the same level has to be
playable on both. Off, the `[F5]` views draw twenty tiles and fog, which is a
landscape that ends thirty paces out. On, everything past that is drawn as
**one box per group of cells** — as tall as the tallest column in the group and
in that column's colour, no textures and no per-block faces — out to six times
the distance, and the fog moves out with it so it is a horizon rather than a
wall of weather. This is what
[Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons) does for
Minecraft, and it makes the same trade: a group is a box, so a valley inside
one is filled in and a lone tower makes its whole group tall. Two ring sizes
rather than one — four cells to a box where it meets the detailed terrain,
sixteen out at the horizon — because a single size is either a visible
staircase up close or thousands of boxes far away. Off by default, because the
machine that needs the setting is the one that cannot afford it turned on.


## Custom key binds (rebind anything)

Nothing in the engine names a key any more. Gameplay asks whether an **action**
is down — `JUMP`, `INTERACT`, `EDITOR_UNDO`, `AUTO_REROLL` — and the player
decides what "down" means, from a controls menu reachable wherever a game is
running:

- every game type's **main menu** and the **game-type editor**,
- the **pause menu** while playing, and the creative editor's
  **Controls (Key Binds)…** tool, both of which open the same sheet *over* the
  level so rebinding mid-session costs you neither the level nor the server
  connection,
- the **Auto Battler**, **Council of Six** and **Evolution** lobbies, and
  Evolution's pause menu — each of which opens the screen on **its own game's
  keys** plus the menu keys, because a mini game is a separate game with a
  separate keyboard and its player is not looking for the creative editor's
  brush sizes.

The **launch screen** deliberately has no controls row: it is the one screen in
the engine with no game running, which made it the one place where "which
controls?" had no answer.

**Any key, any mouse button.** A slot takes whatever you press: a letter, a
function key, the numpad, `Ctrl+S`-style combinations (hold the modifiers while
you press), the left/middle/right mouse buttons, or the **side buttons** on a
gaming mouse. Input state is tracked in sets rather than a fixed 256-entry
table, so keys like **F13-F24** and buttons past the familiar three are bindable
like everything else.

**Two slots per action.** Each action keeps a primary and an alternate, which is
how the defaults are already shaped (`A` *and* Left Arrow both walk left). Leave
one empty, or empty both to unbind an action entirely.

**How to use the screen**

| Action | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Enter** / click a slot | Listen for the new binding — press any key or mouse button |
| **Esc** | Back out of listening, leaving the slot as it was |
| **Del** / right-click a slot | Empty the slot |
| **Left/Right** | Move between the primary and alternate slot |
| *Reset All to Defaults* | Put every action back on the key it ships with |

Two actions in the **same group** sharing a binding are drawn in red as a
warning (they still work — it is your engine). The same button doing different
jobs in *different* groups is normal and is not flagged: the left mouse button
attacks while playing and paints while editing, and those two never happen at
once.

**Where it is saved.** One file for the whole engine —
`src/main/resources/config/keybinds.json` — because controls belong to the
person playing, not to a game type. Rebind jump once and it is rebound in every
game type, level and mode, this session and the next. The file is plain,
readable JSON with stable key names, so it can be copied between machines:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "binds": {
    "move_left": ["key:A", "key:LEFT"],
    "jump": ["key:SPACE"],
    "attack": ["mouse:1"],
    "editor_undo": ["ctrl+key:Z"],
    "editor_redo": ["ctrl+key:Y", "ctrl+shift+key:Z"]
  }
}
```

Missing entries fall back to the shipped default (so binds saved by an older
build still load when the engine grows a new action), an entry with an empty
list stays deliberately unbound, and an unreadable file is simply "the
defaults" — the game always starts with working controls.

**Adding a bindable action** (engine code):

```java
// 1. Declare it, with the keys it ships with, in GameAction:
INTERACT("interact", "Interact (doors, chests, mounts)", Category.ITEMS,
        InputBinding.key(KeyEvent.VK_E)),

// 2. Ask for it where you used to name a key:
if (KeyBinds.pressed(input, GameAction.INTERACT)) openDoor();   // rising edge
if (KeyBinds.down(input, GameAction.SPRINT))      run();        // held
```

That is the whole job: the controls menu is built from `GameAction.values()`,
so the new action shows up there, saves with the rest, and is rebindable the day
it is added. A form anywhere in the engine can host rebinding rows directly with
`ConfigForm.addKeyBind(binds, action)`, or the whole sheet with
`KeyBindForm.build(...)`.

---

## Skins (texture overrides)

Every game texture is overridable with your own art, without touching code:

1. Drop PNG **sprite sheets** anywhere under
   [`resources/skins/`](src/main/resources/skins/) (`units/`, `items/`,
   `projectiles/`, `boards/` are provided as a starting layout, kept in the
   repo with `.gitkeep`).
2. In the Auto Battler lobby, open **Customize Skins** and pick a target:
   any **unit** (per **animation state** — idle, walk, attack, cast, hit,
   death; a unit with only an idle skin uses it everywhere), any **item**,
   a **projectile** kind (arrow / orb / bolt), or the **board tiles**.
3. Define the sheet import: **frame pixel width**, **frame pixel height**,
   **frame count** (sliced left-to-right, top-to-bottom), and a **framerate
   from 0 to 120** sprite frames per second (0 = static image).
4. **Apply + Save** — it takes effect live, with a preview right in the menu.

Assignments persist to `resources/skins/skins.json` — part of *your* game
files ([`SkinStore`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/SkinStore.java)),
loaded on every launch, and bundled into the [share jar](#sharing-the-game--how-joining-works)
so friends see your skins too. Anything without a (working) skin keeps the
engine's procedural art — a bad path never breaks the game. The runtime side
is [`Skins`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/Skins.java): game code
asks for a texture key's frame at a point in time and draws the fallback when
it gets `null`; the key table is documented in
[`resources/skins/README.md`](src/main/resources/skins/README.md).

### Texture packs (drop-in art)

Assigning sheets one at a time is the *precise* route. The **texture pack**
is the bulk one: a `textures/` folder **next to the jar**, filled with
correctly-named PNGs, reskins the game with **no menu visit at all**
([`TexturePack`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/TexturePack.java)).
Launching from IntelliJ scaffolds an empty one inside `share/`, so it ships
with the game you hand a friend:

```

**Subfolders are palette categories, files are objects.** A sheet is picked
up purely by where it sits and what it's called — `blocks/dirt.png` is the
Dirt block, `mobs/slime.png` is the Slime in every animation state (add
`_walk` for one state only, and `_walk_e` for one state in one **facing** —
see [directional animations](#directional-animations)), `player/idle.png` is
the player standing still, `particles/embers.png` is the ember particle.
The generated `TEXTURE_KEYS.txt` lists **every object in the game** with the
exact file name and texture key to use, including custom content you created
yourself — so nobody has to guess or memorize a key. PNG is preferred; GIF
and JPG load too.

**Blocks have a second pool, for the plan-view perspectives.** A side-scroller
and a 3D level look at *different faces* of the same block,
and one sheet cannot be both a wall seen edge-on and a floor seen from above.
So `blocks_top/` supplies the face a plan view looks down at (floors, and the
lid of a [stacked block](#stacked-blocks-the-plan-views-geometry)) and
`blocks_side/` the face a stacked block turns toward the camera, which is what
gives a wall its height. Both are optional and independent: a block with no top
or side sheet falls back to its `blocks/` sheet, and with none of the three to
its procedural colour, so a pack can dress one format, both, or neither.
**"+ New Block" always asks** which faces your block has and names the exact
files to draw for them.

**Screen furniture is in the pack too.** `ui/minigame_<game>.png` is the picture
button that opens a mini game from the launch screen. Its sheet is read as
**three states laid out left to right** — resting, pointed at, pressed — rather
than as an animation, because a picture button with one frame cannot say that
the pointer is on it or that a press registered. Supply all three at the same
frame size; a pack that supplies none gets the generated plaques the engine
draws from each game's own accent colour
([`StandaloneGame`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/minigame/StandaloneGame.java),
[`MiniGameSprites`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/MiniGameSprites.java)).

**One spec for the whole pack.** Every sheet plays at the universal settings
in `texturepack.json` — **32×32 frames, 3 frames, 3 fps** — so a pack is
drawn to a single target (the default sheet is one 96×32 image, sliced
left-to-right). Any single texture can depart from that via the `overrides`
block, or from the creative texture dialog, which writes the override back
into the pack.

**Art drawn in game lands here.** The creative editor's
[Create texture](#create-texture-draw-the-sprite-sheet-in-game) window saves
the sheet it painted into this folder under the object's own file name, with
its frame size/length/rate written into `texturepack.json` — so a texture
drawn in game is the same kind of thing as one dropped in by hand, and
travels with the pack.

**Always safe to leave on.** The pack is consulted for every texture key by
default, and a key with no file in it keeps its built-in procedural icon —
so a pack can be one file or a thousand. Per object, the texture dialog can
switch the pack off or point at [a sheet somewhere
else](#creative-mode-paint-objects) instead. A game type that wants its pack
kept elsewhere sets *Texture pack folder* in that dialog; blank — the normal
case — means "beside the jar", which is what makes a shared game just work.

---

## Sound (every action state)

Sound works exactly like [texture packs](#texture-packs-drop-in-art), and for
the same reason: a creator should be able to give their game a voice by
**dropping files in a folder**, without visiting a menu or writing a line of
code. The difference is that sound is *silent by default* — every one of the
game's sound keys makes no noise at all until you supply audio for it.

### Sound keys: object + action state

A **sound key** names an object and something it does
([`SoundKeys`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/audio/SoundKeys.java)):

```
player/jump                       the player jumping
player/swim                       swimming (repeats while you swim)
player/run                        sprinting footsteps
player/ult_activate               firing an ultimate
character/rogue/hurt              the Rogue's own cry (falls back to player/hurt)
block/dirt/break                  breaking Dirt
block/dirt/step                   walking on Dirt
block/water/splash                falling into Water
mob/slime/attack                  the Slime lunging
mob/slime/death                   the Slime dying
mob/royal_guard/shield_up         the Royal Guard bracing behind its shield
item/iron_sword/use               drawing the Iron Sword
item/iron_sword/swing             …and cutting the air with it
item/iron_sword/swing_hit         …and landing it
item/tower_shield/parry_success   the clang of a blow caught on a guard
projectile/meteor/fire            a meteor being called down
projectile/meteor/flight          the meteor falling (repeats until it lands)
projectile/meteor/impact          the meteor crashing
ultimate/meteor_volley/activate   casting the volley
music/level  ·  music/boss        the level's music
ambient/night  ·  door/open  ·  minigame/victory  ·  ui/click
```

The engine currently names **~2,000 of these**, because every object in every
registry gets the full set of action states for its kind — and that includes
the blocks, mobs, items, decorations and characters you create with the
palette's **"+ New …"** buttons, which register into the same registries the
catalogue reads. Make a new mob and it arrives with `spawn`, `idle`, `step`,
`attack`, `hurt` and `death` — plus the ten
[melee-move states](#melee-combat-swing-parry-lunge-dash-shield) every
fighter and every held object has — waiting for audio.

Keys fall back one segment at a time, exactly like texture keys, so
`mobs/slime.wav` alone gives a Slime one voice for everything it does, and
adding `mobs/slime_death.wav` beside it takes over just for dying. The engine
also asks for the *specific* sound before the general one: a footstep tries
`block/stone/step`, then `character/rogue/walk`, then `player/walk`, and goes
quiet if you supplied none of them.

### Sound packs (drop-in audio)

A `sounds/` folder **next to the jar**, filled with correctly-named WAVs and
MP3s, gives the game its voice with no menu visit
([`SoundPack`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/audio/SoundPack.java)).
Launching from IntelliJ scaffolds an empty one inside `share/`, beside the
texture pack, so it ships with the game you hand a friend:

```
share/sounds/
├── soundpack.json    volume · pitch · pitch drift  (+ per-sound overrides)
├── SOUND_KEYS.txt    every sound in the game and the file to name it (generated)
├── README.txt
├── player/       jump.wav · swim.wav · run.wav · ult_activate.wav · parry.wav · …
├── blocks/       dirt_break.wav · stone_place.wav · …
├── liquids/      water_splash.wav · lava_ambient.wav · …
├── mobs/         slime.wav (everything it does) · slime_death.wav (just dying)
├── items/        iron_sword_use.wav · iron_sword_swing.wav (a melee move) · …
├── projectiles/  meteor_fire.wav · meteor_flight.wav · meteor_impact.wav
├── ultimates/    meteor_volley_activate.wav · nova_burst_impact.wav · …
├── music/        level.mp3 · boss.mp3 · menu.mp3 · …
├── lights/  ·  decor/  ·  block_decor/  ·  vehicles/  ·  particles/
├── ui/  ·  world/  ·  ambient/  ·  doors/  ·  cutscenes/  ·  minigame/
```

**WAV and MP3 both load.** WAV, AIFF and AU go through the JDK; MP3 goes
through the engine's own decoder
([`Mp3Decoder`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/audio/Mp3Decoder.java)) — a
complete MPEG-1/2/2.5 Layer III decoder in pure Java, ported from the
public-domain [minimp3](https://github.com/lieff/minimp3) (CC0), because the
JDK has no MP3 support and the engine ships with **no third-party jars** by
design. A file whose contents disagree with its extension is retried the
other way, so a `.wav` that is really an MP3 still plays.

**Everything defaults to silence.** A sound key with no file makes no noise.
The one exception is the handful of actions the engine has always had a
synthesized voice for — placing and breaking blocks, hitting a mob, picking
an item up, jumping, firing, exploding, menu clicks — which keep theirs, so
adding two thousand new sound slots doesn't silence a game that already made
noise ([`SoundSynth`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/audio/SoundSynth.java)).
Each of those is still a normal sound key, so a pack overrides it like
anything else, and the editor can switch the built-in off to make the action
genuinely silent.

### Fresh pitch (the Minecraft trick)

**Every sound plays at a slightly different pitch each time** — ±8% by
default, drawn per playback. It is the reason a run of footsteps or a burst
of block-breaking sounds alive instead of like a stuck record, and it is the
same thing Minecraft does as you move around the world.

It is a **toggle** in the sound editor (*Fresh pitch each time*), with a
slider for the spread (0–50%), and it is saved with the game type and in the
pack's `soundpack.json` so the feel travels with the folder. Music is never
pitch-varied — a wandering soundtrack is a bug, not an effect — and any
individual sound can opt out.

Pitch is possible at all because the engine mixes sound in software
([`SoundMixer`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/audio/SoundMixer.java)):
voices are resampled as they play, so any number of sounds overlap, each at
its own pitch, volume and stereo position, with music looping underneath. On
a machine with no audio device — CI, a container, a dedicated server — the
mixer disables itself silently and every call is a no-op, so gameplay code
never has to ask whether sound exists.

### The sound editor (creative mode)

Creative mode has a **SOUNDS** palette category. It opens **the whole list**:
every place the game makes a noise, what that sound currently resolves to,
and the dialog to change it.

```
SOUNDS palette
├── Sound Editor…        every sound in the game, one row each
├── Sound Options…       master/effects/music volume · fresh pitch · pack folder ·
│                     whether this machine has an audio device at all
├── Level Music…         which music/… track this level plays
└── Player Sounds… · Blocks… · Mobs… · Items… · Ultimate abilities… ·
    Projectiles… · Vehicles… · Music… · Ambience… · Mini games… · …
    (one entry per family, opening the list filtered to it)
```

Each row reads `Slime — attack · pack: mobs/slime_attack.wav`, or
`· silent`, or `· built-in`. A **Show sounds** filter narrows the list to
*only the silent ones* (what still needs audio) or *only the ones with
audio*. Clicking a row opens that one sound:

- **Use sound pack folder** — on by default; this folder supplies the audio.
- **Pack file: `player/swim.wav` ✓ found** / *(not there yet — click to
  rescan)* — the exact file to create, and whether it is there yet. Clicking
  rescans, for files added while the game is running.
- **Sound file elsewhere** + **Browse…** — point this one sound at any WAV
  or MP3 on disk instead.
- **Volume**, **Pitch**, **Loop while the state holds**, **Fresh pitch each
  time**, and **Built-in fallback** (for the keys that have one).
- **▶ Preview** plays it as the dialog currently stands.

Volume/pitch/loop are written into the pack's own `soundpack.json`, so those
exceptions travel with the folder; the pack switch and any explicit path go
to `sounds.json` beside `skins.json`. *Rewrite SOUND_KEYS.txt* regenerates
the key list against the objects that exist right now, including everything
you just created.

### What actually makes noise

Triggers are wired through the level loader — the play scene and creative
mode's **play-test**, so a level under test sounds exactly like the level
being played. One-shot events fire where they happen; anything that has to be
watched frame to frame lives in
[`SceneSounds`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/audio/SceneSounds.java):

| What | Sounds |
| --- | --- |
| **Player** | footsteps timed to the gait (walk/run/swim), jump, double jump, landing, splash going in and out of water, sprint start, hurt, death, respawn, mining scrape, break, place, chop, pickup, drop, eat, drink, craft, teleport, door entry, mount/dismount |
| **Ultimates** | the meter filling (`charged`), the cast (`activate`), a sustained ability's hum (`loop`), what it does where it lands (`impact`), and the effect ending (`end`) |
| **Meteors** | the volley being cast, each meteor's `flight` looping as it falls, and its `impact`/`explode` where it lands — three separate sounds for one ability |
| **Blocks** | place, break, the scrape while mining, footsteps per block underfoot, hits; liquids add splash, swim, flow and a lapping ambience |
| **Mobs** | spawn, idle murmurs, footsteps as they close, the lunge into an attack, hurt, death — positioned and faded by distance so a horde off-screen is a murmur |
| **Items** | use, equip, pickup, drop, craft, and a tool breaking |
| **Projectiles** | fire, flight, impact, explode — per projectile type |
| **World** | level load/save/generate, daybreak, nightfall, chests, crafting stations, stat rules firing, explosions |
| **Music** | per level (`Level Music…`), plus menu, creative, combat, boss, victory and defeat tracks |
| **Everything else** | doors, cutscenes, mini-game scoring and rounds, vehicles, particles, block decorations, and the interface |

Levels store their own music track, so a boss arena can ask for `music/boss`
while the caves next door play `music/level` — the track travels with the
level like its other settings do.

## Sharing the game & how joining works

**Launching the game from IntelliJ automatically builds a shareable copy**
in `share/`, in the background, on every launch
([`ShareJar`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/core/ShareJar.java) — skipped
when nothing changed):

```
share/
├── larsons-game-engine.jar      # the whole game: java -jar, Java 21+, no deps
├── run.bat                      # double-click launcher (Windows)
├── run.sh                       # double-click launcher (Mac/Linux)
├── HOW_TO_PLAY_ONLINE.txt       # hosting/joining instructions + your LAN IP
├── textures/                    # drop-in texture pack (see Texture packs)
└── sounds/                      # drop-in sound pack   (see Sound)
```

**This only happens inside IntelliJ.** The share folder is a development
convenience, so a shipped game never writes a copy of itself beside wherever
the player put it. `ShareJar` looks for two kinds of evidence:

- **Direct launch markers** — IntelliJ's own `idea.*` system properties, the
  `idea_rt` helper on the classpath or attached as an agent, its
  `com.intellij.rt` launcher, the `IDEA_*` environment and its built-in
  terminal. These cover an *Application* run configuration.
- **The project checkout** — a `.idea/` folder in the working directory
  *and* the game running from **class files rather than a jar**. This one
  matters because IntelliJ's default for a Gradle project is "build and run
  using Gradle": the game is forked into a fresh JVM by the Gradle daemon,
  which inherits none of the markers above. (`build.gradle.kts` also hands
  `idea.active` down through that fork, so both signals agree.)

A player is excluded by either half — they run a jar, and have no `.idea/`
beside it. A `./gradlew run` from a terminal *in the same checkout* does
build the folder; it's the same developer on the same project.
`-Dlarsons.share=true` (or `false`) overrides the whole check. When a launch
from class files is skipped, the console says so rather than leaving you
wondering.

Send a friend the `share/` folder (or just the jar) and they can play — and
because the jar packages your `resources/`, your game types and skins travel
with it. The `textures/` folder rides along too, so they can reskin the game
by dropping PNGs beside the jar.

**Connecting — which address do I type?**

| You are... | Address to join |
|------------|-----------------|
| On the **same machine** as the host (testing with two windows) | `localhost:7788` |
| On the **same network** (same house / wifi / LAN) | the **host's LAN IP**, e.g. `192.168.1.23:7788` |
| Somewhere else on the internet | the host's **public IP**, with TCP port 7788 forwarded on their router |

`localhost` (127.0.0.1) always means *"this same computer"* — it loops back
before ever reaching the network, so it can never reach a host on another
machine, even on the same wifi. For same-network play the host's **lobby
screen shows the exact address to share** ("Same network? They join:
192.168.x.x:7788", via [`Lan`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/net/Lan.java)),
and it's also written into `share/HOW_TO_PLAY_ONLINE.txt`. No port
forwarding is needed on a LAN — that's only for internet play, exactly like
hosting a Minecraft server. The world game works the same way on its default
port 7777.

---

## Online play

Online play (requirement #3) works like Minecraft Java edition: someone hosts
a server on a port, everyone else connects to `ip:port`.

**Hosting from the game:** main menu → *Multiplayer* → set a port → *Host
Server + Play*. This starts an integrated server with **your** active game
type and level and joins it locally. Friends on your LAN connect to your local
IP; friends over the internet connect to your public IP (forward the TCP port
on your router, exactly like a Minecraft server).

**Joining:** main menu → *Multiplayer* → type `host` or `host:port` (port
defaults to 7777) → *Join Server*. The server sends its game type **and the
level itself** on join, so clients don't need the host's files — you play
exactly the world the host configured.

**Dedicated server** (headless, no window — run it on any machine with a JDK):

```bash
./gradlew runServer --args="--port 7777 --level levels/sample_level.json --gametype platformer"
# or from the jar:
java -cp build/libs/Larsons-Game-Engine-0.1.0.jar com.larsons.engine.net.ServerMain --port 7777
```

### How the netcode works

The server is **authoritative** — the model the fixed-timestep loop was
designed for: *input commands in, state snapshots out*.

- Clients never send positions. Each tick the client sends a
  [`PlayerInput`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/PlayerInput.java)
  (left/right/up/down + sequence number); the server drains each player's
  queued inputs (so edge-triggered jumps and attack clicks are never lost
  between ticks, however fast the client sends) and steps
  [`PlayerPhysics`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/sim/PlayerPhysics.java)
  at a fixed 60 Hz — paced with the same precise coarse-sleep/fine-park
  waits as the render loop, so the tick rate holds on every OS — then
  broadcasts snapshots at 30 Hz. Cheating by teleporting isn't possible,
  and a laggy client only degrades itself.
- **Prediction & reconciliation:** the local player runs the *identical*
  `PlayerPhysics` step locally, so movement feels instant. Snapshots echo the
  last input sequence the server applied; the client rewinds to that
  authoritative state, **replays its still-unacknowledged inputs**, and
  compares like with like — when both simulations agree nothing tugs at the
  player, so there is no rubber-banding at any ping (small residual errors
  blend away smoothly, large ones snap).
- **Interpolation:** remote players *and* replicated entities are drawn
  ~70 ms in the past, blended between the two buffered snapshots straddling
  that moment, so everything moves smoothly regardless of snapshot timing.
- **Entity replication:** the server simulates mobs, dropped items, and
  projectiles in flight (the same `World` code single-player runs) and
  includes them in snapshots; clients just render them. Snapshots also carry
  the time of day, so the lighting pass darkens every screen in sync.
- **World edits:** placing and creative painting are requests
  (`edit`/`paint`/`erase`); the server validates them against the host's
  feature toggles, applies them on the tick thread, and broadcasts the
  authoritative `block` result to everyone (bursts — liquid flow, explosions —
  batch into one `blocks` message). **Play-mode mining is hold-to-mine
  online too:** the mining intent rides the input command and the server
  accumulates progress against the block's hardness (matching tools speed it
  up, finished blocks wear the tool), so durability behaves exactly as
  offline. Late joiners get the *live* level — serialized compact +
  run-length-encoded so even giant custom levels fit the handshake — so an
  hour of collaborative painting is never lost on them.
- **Combat, shooting & pickups:** attack intent rides the input command
  (edge-triggered by sequence number so one click is one swing), along with
  the player's hotbar selection — so the server knows what each player holds
  and resolves accordingly: a melee swing (weapon damage included), or a
  **projectile** for a held ranged weapon/throwable, spending ammo from that
  player's **server-side inventory**. Impacts broadcast as `fx` events so
  everyone sees the same explosion. Loot and pickups land server-side, and
  each change pushes the authoritative inventory down to its owner.
- **Inventory actions:** moving/merging/swapping stacks, dropping items into
  the world, and eating food are requests (`invmove`/`invdrop`/`use`) the
  server validates and applies — and play-mode block placement consumes the
  matching block item from the placer's inventory, so blocks can't be
  conjured from nothing.
- **Wire protocol:** newline-delimited compact JSON over TCP, built on the
  engine's own `Json` — zero dependencies (requirement #4) and debuggable
  with `telnet`. See [`Protocol`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/net/Protocol.java)
  for the full message flow (join/welcome handshake with a protocol version,
  input, state, info events, ping/pong RTT measurement that doubles as the
  keep-alive).
- **Threading:** one accept thread, a reader + queued writer per connection
  (a slow client can never stall the simulation; if its queue overflows it is
  disconnected), and one tick thread that owns all state. Silent connections
  time out after 15 s.

The pause menu never edits features (per-level toggles are edited in Level Select
→ Edit Settings); in multiplayer the simulation keeps running server-side while
the menu is open, again like Minecraft.

---

## Infinite terrain (worlds that generate themselves)

Tick **Infinite terrain** in a 3D level's settings and the level stops being a
canvas and becomes a *world*: its bounds grow to 16,384 blocks a side, the
blocks that were authored are moved into the middle of that, and everything
outside them is generated as you walk into it. Turn it off again and generation
stops, keeping the ground that has already been explored.

Everything below is edited in the level's own settings menu — **New Level**
before it exists, **Level Select → Edit Settings** afterwards — and saved inside
the level, so one game type can hold an endless overworld beside a hand-built
dungeon.

### What the world is made of

Terrain is **biome-driven, and the biomes are data**
([`Biome`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/gen/Biome.java),
[`Biomes`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/gen/Biomes.java)). Eighteen come
as standard — ten above ground (**plains, deciduous forest, pine forest, icy
tundra, mountains, tropics, jungle, desert, village, ancient city**) and eight
below it (**caves, glowing rainbow caves, ice caves, acid caves, obsidian caves,
lava caves, water caves, ancient temple**) — and nothing in the generator knows
those names. The settings menu edits one biome at a time behind a picker, and
**+ New above-ground biome** / **+ New below-ground biome** add your own. A world
built entirely out of biomes you invented works exactly as well as the standard
one.

Every biome answers four questions, and every answer is a row in the menu:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Where does it belong** | above ground or below, likelihood 0–100, temperature and humidity 0–100 |
| **What shape is the ground** | target generation level (0–512 — the level's own height axis) and how far it wanders from it |
| **What it is made of** | surface, subsurface, stone, shoreline and liquid blocks, soil depth, water level offset, snowy |
| **What grows on it** | tree density with its own trunk and canopy blocks and height range, ground cover, a list of scattered decorations, cave density, ore richness, a glowing block, and buildings with their own wall and roof blocks |

Land starts at **layer 150** and climbs; everything at or below **layer 149**
floods. Mountains reach past 280, ocean floors sink into the 120s, and caves are
carved out of the rock by two 3D noise fields and then *dressed* by whichever
underground biome owns their depth — so an ice cave is blue ice and frost near
the top of the rock and a lava cave is basalt and a lava lake at the bottom of
the world. Villages and ancient cities level a plot, build on it and light it.

The world palette exists so those biomes have something to be made of: **71 new
blocks** — six kinds of tree, podzol and red sand and terracotta, coral and sea
grass and lily pads, dripstone and stalagmites and glowing lichen, rainbow
crystal and sulphur and magma stone, and a building set of ancient bricks,
gilded bricks, rune stone, village planks and hay bales. They are ordinary
blocks: paintable in creative mode, minable in play, and available to levels that
never turn generation on.

### How it stays fast

- **Columns, not cells.** A column of the world is stored run-length encoded
  from bedrock to sky
  ([`WorldTerrain`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/gen/WorldTerrain.java)),
  so a mountain three hundred blocks tall is about eight pairs of numbers.
  Storing the same world as one grid per layer would be hundreds of megabytes
  for what fits in twelve, and "how tall is the ground here" is the last number
  in an array rather than three hundred reads.
- **Chunks, streamed.** Columns live in 32×32 chunks built on background worker
  threads well ahead of where you are walking, dropped furthest-first once the
  budget is passed, and rebuilt *identically* from the seed when you come back.
  Generation never happens on the frame that needs it.
- **Only what can be seen is drawn, and it is worked out once.** Which faces of
  a column are exposed is a fact about five columns of neighbours and cannot
  change unless one of them does — so it is computed when the ground changes and
  kept, and a frame reads an array
  ([`WorldTerrain.columnFaces`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/gen/WorldTerrain.java)).
  That is Minecraft's chunk mesh in the shape this engine's storage takes, and
  it halved the detailed sweep: 22.4 ms to 10.8 at a four-chunk detail distance,
  measured.
  *Walled in* means hidden by something that actually hides it: a flower, a pane
  of glass and the surface of a lake do not, which is why the ground under
  everything the generator scatters is drawn rather than seen through. A
  neighbour of the *same* block does, which is what keeps a lake from costing a
  face per layer of its depth.
- **A frame never builds the world it is drawing.** The sweep reads the world as
  it stands and draws nothing where a chunk has not arrived yet — at the far
  edge of the view, in the fog, for as long as it takes a worker thread to hand
  it over. Reads that *must* have an answer (a body standing on ground) still
  build what they need.
- **A horizon that costs the same at any distance.** The far field is a cached
  level-of-detail tree
  ([`WorldLod`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/world/gen/WorldLod.java)) whose
  tiles are chosen so a sample subtends the same angle wherever it is, so
  pushing the horizon out adds rings that each cost what the first one did.
- **The far field is built once, not per frame.** A tile is meshed on a worker
  thread and kept until something edits the ground under it. The pass it
  replaced re-sampled the whole horizon every frame, which at two thousand
  blocks was most of what the horizon cost.
- **Greedy-meshed.** A tile's samples are merged into the largest rectangles
  that share a height and a block before anything is drawn, so a plain, a
  seabed or a plateau is a handful of quads rather than a thousand — and a
  merged box is level across its whole footprint, so it can be trusted to
  occlude what is behind it.

### The world on the GPU

The `[F5]` views have two renderers behind them, and the difference between
them is a depth buffer.

The **painter** (`SolidPainter`) sorts every face of every frame — it has
nothing else to sort with, Java2D having no depth buffer — and that is exactly
what stops its geometry from being kept: an order that depends on where the
camera is cannot be computed once. It is the JDK-only path, it works on a bare
JRE, and it is what every level fell back to before there was anything else.

The **GPU path** is Minecraft's, piece for piece:

| piece | what it is | where |
|---|---|---|
| Chunk sections | the world in 16³ blocks, meshed when it changes and not again | [`SectionMesher`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/chunk/SectionMesher.java) |
| Smooth lighting | per-vertex ambient occlusion, including the diagonal flip | same |
| Cave culling | per-section face-to-face connectivity by flood fill, then a breadth-first walk out from the camera | [`SectionVisibility`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/chunk/SectionVisibility.java), [`SectionRenderList`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/chunk/SectionRenderList.java) |
| Block atlas | every sheet in one texture, so terrain is one bind | [`BlockAtlas`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/graphics/chunk/BlockAtlas.java) |
| Render layers | opaque near-to-far with depth writes, then translucent far-to-near without | [`GlTerrainPass`](gl/src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/gl/GlTerrainPass.java) |
| Cutout alpha | a leaf's holes discard rather than writing depth | `GlTerrainProgram` |

**Almost all of it is on the CPU and none of it needs a graphics card to
test.** Deciding what the world looks like — which sections exist, which faces
are exposed, how occluded each corner is, which sections can be seen and in
what order — is `com.larsons.engine.graphics.chunk`, and `GpuTerrainTest`
exercises the lot. What is left for the GL module is uploading arrays and
issuing draw calls. A renderer whose correctness lives in a shader is a
renderer nobody can test.

What it costs the processor per frame, measured over generated terrain — the
section walk, which is the whole of the CPU's job once the meshes exist:

| detail distance | painter's sweep | GPU walk | quads on screen |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 chunks | 10.8 ms | **0.036 ms** | 21 000 |
| 8 chunks | 53.5 ms | **0.130 ms** | 122 000 |
| 16 chunks | (minutes) | **0.805 ms** | 232 000 |

Two to three hundred times less processor, and a quarter of a million quads is
an ordinary frame for any GPU made this decade. The detail distance stops being
the thing that decides a frame rate, which is what the depth buffer bought.

**The two agree about where a vertex lands.** `Mat4.perspective` is derived
from `EyeCamera`'s own focal length rather than from the textbook
`gluPerspective`, and `GpuTerrainTest` pins the two to within a hundredth of a
pixel — so switching backends does not move the picture.

**What still goes through the painter** on the GPU path: the plants, the
actors, the level's scenery and the far field's level-of-detail tree. Those are
billboards and merged landforms rather than geometry a section mesh has a
version of. They are drawn afterwards, at their own depths
(`DrawTarget.pushDepth`), so the terrain the GPU drew hides the ones standing
behind it.

### How far you can see, and how much of it is blocks

Four sliders, all in the **pause menu** while you are looking at what they
change (a chunk is 16 blocks, as in Minecraft):

| slider | reaches | what it costs |
|---|---|---|
| **Render distance** | 90 chunks (1440 blocks) | almost nothing — it is drawn by the level-of-detail tree |
| **Detail distance** | 90 chunks, defaults to **4** | *this is the frame*: it grows with the area it covers |
| **Decorations** | 90 chunks, defaults to 12 | a stem and a billboard each, so its own dial |
| **Distant generation** | 256 chunks (4096 blocks) | a millisecond and a half at full stretch |

They were on the editor's level-settings screen, which is the one place a
player cannot reach: judging a view distance means seeing the view, and
answering *"is this what is costing me the frame rate"* used to mean leaving
the level, opening the editor, changing a number and coming back.

**Detail distance is the one that matters**, and the reason is arithmetic: the
detailed sweep's cost grows with the *area* it covers, so four times the
distance is sixteen times the faces however well each one is culled. Measured
over generated terrain at 1280×720, the sweep alone — 2 chunks 2.4 ms, 4
chunks 10.3, 6 chunks 26.9, 8 chunks 53.5. Everything past it is drawn by the
tree instead, for about a millisecond however far the render distance goes.
Which is why one of these sliders reaches ninety chunks and the other one
should not.

What that buys, measured on the same ground and the same camera at the default
detail distance of four chunks:

| view | frame | of which CPU (sweep + far field) |
|---|---|---|
| 12 chunks, no distant generation | 38.0 ms | 11.4 ms |
| 90 chunks, no distant generation | 45.4 ms | 11.8 ms |
| 90 chunks + 256 chunks of distant generation | 48.4 ms | 12.7 ms |

Seven times the view distance and a horizon four thousand blocks deep for
**1.3 ms** of processor. The rest of each frame is Java2D rasterising the
quads in software, which is what the GPU backend exists to take over.

Seen from the **plan view** a generated world is drawn as a height-shaded map
rather than as extrusions: lifting a column of three hundred one tile per layer
draws a cross-section of the crust in which the landscape is the last four
pixels. Press `F5` into first or third person to walk about in it, which is
where a world of this shape is meant to be seen from.

### What a save carries

The seed, the list of chunks that have been visited, and the contents of the
chunks that have been **changed** — never the terrain itself, which is a function
of the seed and would be gigabytes to write down. Two levels with the same seed
and the same biomes are the same world, block for block.

- **Turning it off** freezes the world: the ground that has been explored still
  loads, and a chunk nobody has ever reached is now empty rather than a continent
  waiting to happen. The explored list becomes the level's new boundary.
- **Retuning a biome, moving the sea level or typing a new seed** regrows the
  ground you have not built on and leaves everything you *have* built standing
  exactly where it was.
- **Save every explored chunk** writes the visited ground down as well, for a
  world that has to survive a change of recipe.

## Game types, levels & feature toggles

A **game type** is a named **folder of levels**, stored as a JSON
[`GameProfile`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/config/GameProfile.java). The
idea: the engine is one big level loader, and a level's toggles tell it which
features to turn on so the *same* engine can drive a platformer, an overworld
adventure, a block builder, etc.

**Feature settings belong to a level, and only to a level.** Every level
carries its own copy ([`Level.settings`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/Level.java)),
so a single game type can group wildly different levels — a lit, gravity-on
boss arena next to an unlit, 3D puzzle room. Loading a level loads its
settings.

**The game type has no feature settings to edit.** Its own copy is pinned to
the engine defaults ([`resetFeaturesToDefaults`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/config/GameProfile.java)),
so the template a new level starts from is one predictable thing. This is
deliberate: a value set on the game type could only ever act at a distance —
days later, on a level created long afterwards, from a screen the creator had
left — while that level's own settings form sat there showing something
different. One question asked in two places, only one of which is visible where
it takes effect, is worse than the flexibility it bought. The profile still
carries the name, the texture pack, the sound pack, and which level to open by
default.

**Flow on launch:**

1. **Startup** — pick an existing game (to keep creating levels within it)
   or *+ Create New Game*. The list shows game names and nothing else: a game
   type is a folder that can hold levels of both formats, so a level type on
   that row could only ever be right about some of them.
2. **Editor** — name it. That is the whole screen.
3. **Save** — written to `resources/gametypes/<name>.json`.
4. **Main menu** — **Level Select** lists the game type's individual levels
   ([`LevelSelectScene`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/LevelSelectScene.java)).
   Click a level and you get four buttons: **Play** (which then asks *which
   saved run* to play it in, rather than inheriting whichever slot was last
   touched), **Edit in Creative** (open it in the editor, in the format it was
   built in, with its own settings in force — the way to go back to building a
   level without playing it and pausing first), **Edit Settings** (a form to
   **rename the level** and edit *that level's* own toggles, saved back into the
   level), and **Delete Level** (behind a confirmation whose default choice is
   to keep it). There is no separate *Play Level* row on the main menu: it
   opened whichever level the profile happened to point at last, which is a
   play button whose level was chosen days ago and which the menu could not
   name. Renaming the game type is part of **Edit Game Type**
   ([`GameTypeRename`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/config/GameTypeRename.java)),
   which moves the folder — its levels, doors, custom content and saved runs
   travel with it.
5. **New level** — **Creative Mode** asks two questions before it builds
   anything: which **format** (side-scroller, 3D), then the
   **New Level** screen
   ([`NewLevelScene`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/NewLevelScene.java))
   — the level's name, its canvas size, and the same per-level settings form
   *Edit Settings* shows. **Create Level** builds the starter canvas, saves it
   into the game type, and opens the editor on it.
6. **Play** — the level loads with only its own enabled features active. Press
   **Esc** for the **[pause screen](#the-pause-screen)**: the actions on the
   left — *Resume*, *Save Run*, *Save and Quit*, *Options*, *Controls*, *Edit in
   Creative*, *Quit to Menu* — and on the right a live read-out of the run
   (vitals, the level's goals, your counters, the save state, the binds).

Levels are authored and saved in **Creative Mode**, which snapshots the active
toggles into the level on every save, and are stored under
`resources/levels/<game-type>/<level>.json`.

**Currently configurable features** — all of them per level, asked in the two
places a level's settings are decided: *Creative Mode → New Level* (before it
exists) and *Level Select → Edit Settings* (afterwards), both built from
[`ProfileForms`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/ProfileForms.java) so
neither can drift from the other:

| Feature | Type | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Level name | text | renames this level |
| Level format | cycler | Side-Scroller / 3D — this level's own format, which it keeps for life |
| Zoom enabled | toggle | gates the zoom controls + range |
| Min / Max / Default zoom | steppers | enabled only when zoom is on |
| Min / Max framerate | steppers | **Max** is applied live as the render cap |
| Gravity / jumping | toggle | side-scroll falling + jump |
| Show HUD | toggle | on-screen info bar |
| Show grid | toggle | tile grid overlay |
| Mobs (AI creatures) | toggle | spawn + simulate the level's painted mobs |
| Items & inventory | toggle | drops, pickup, hotbar + inventory UI |
| Combat | toggle | swings hurt mobs, mobs hurt players; off = ambient wildlife |
| Projectiles & ranged weapons | toggle | bows/staves/throwables fire; off = melee only |
| Mine / place blocks in play | toggle | left-click mine (with drops), right-click place |
| Creative mode (paint objects) | toggle | the creative editor + online painting |
| Lighting | toggle | the lighting shader pass (works without post-FX) |
| Day/night cycle · Night (fixed) | toggles | time-driven darkness, or a constant night |
| Night darkness · Ambient light | steppers | how dark night gets / the light floor |
| Parallax background | toggle | procedural multi-layer backdrop (side-scroll) |
| Particles | toggle | block-break shards, hit sparks |
| Sound effects | toggle | synthesized SFX (jump, mine, place, pickup, hit…) |
| Tile / Player / Default entity size | steppers | sizes in world pixels |
| Shaders (post-FX) | toggle | master switch for the shader chain |
| Shader strength | stepper | global `uStrength` in [0, 1] |
| Pixelate (+ pixel size), Wave, Chromatic aberration, Bloom, Grayscale, Scanlines, Vignette | toggles | individual passes, applied in that order |
| Export shaders as GLSL | action | writes `.vert`/`.frag` files to `shaders/` |

Adding a new feature is three edits: a field on `GameProfile` (it auto-serializes
via `toMap`/`fromMap`), a row in
[`ProfileForms`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/ProfileForms.java), and
honouring it where it matters (e.g. in `PlayScene`).

```java
// Programmatic use:
GameTypeStore store = new GameTypeStore();        // resources/gametypes/
GameProfile profile = new GameProfile("My Platformer");
profile.perspective = Perspective.SIDE_SCROLL;   // the format new levels start in
profile.zoomEnabled = false;
store.save(profile);                              // -> my_platformer.json
// later:
GameProfile reloaded = store.load("My Platformer");
```

> Game types are written to the **`src/main/resources/gametypes/`** folder, so
> run from the project root (e.g. `./gradlew run`). Bundled example types ship
> on the classpath and also load from a packaged jar.

### Exporting & sharing a game type (`.larsonsengine`)

A finished game type can be handed to someone else as a single file. From the
main menu, **Export Game Type (.larsonsengine)** bundles the game type's profile
**and every level in it** — plus the `doors.json` / `custom.json` that wire those
levels together and define their custom blocks/mobs/items — into one
`<name>.larsonsengine` file
([`GamePackage`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/config/GamePackage.java)). A
level is never exported on its own: it only means something inside the game type
whose features, doors, and custom content it was built against.

The file is written next to the runnable jar (in the `share/` folder when you're
running from IntelliJ). **At launch the engine scans that folder for
`.larsonsengine` files and installs any it hasn't seen** — so a recipient just
drops the file beside their jar and starts the game; the game type appears on
the startup chooser with all its levels. An already-installed game type is left
alone, so re-scanning never clobbers a player's local edits.

**Finalize toggle.** The export dialog has a **Finalize** toggle. When it's on,
the packaged copy is marked *play-only*: after import, its levels can be
**played but not edited** — Creative Mode, per-level *Edit Settings*, feature
edits, and renames are all hidden, and the menu labels the type
`finalized (play-only)`. Finalizing only affects the exported package; your own
local copy stays fully editable. (It's just a `finalized` flag on the
[`GameProfile`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/config/GameProfile.java), so the
lock travels inside the file.)

```java
// Programmatic export/import (roots default to resources/gametypes + resources/levels):
GameProfile profile = new GameTypeStore().load("My Platformer");
Path file = GamePackage.export(profile, new LevelStore("My Platformer"),
                               GamePackage.dropInDir(), /* finalized = */ true);
// on a recipient's machine, at launch:
GamePackage.importDropIns();   // installs any .larsonsengine dropped beside the jar
```

The package is a plain JSON document (the engine's own dependency-free parser
reads it), so it stays inspectable:

```json
{
  "larsonsengine": 1,               // schema version (drives migration)
  "name": "My Platformer",
  "gameType": { "name": "My Platformer", "finalized": true, ... },
  "levels":  { "level_one": { ...level... }, "level_two": { ... } },
  "doors":   { "doors": [ ... ] },
  "custom":  { "blocks": [ ... ], "mobs": [ ... ] }
}
```

**Forward compatibility.** A `.larsonsengine` file exported today is designed to
keep loading in every future build, guaranteed three ways:

1. **It's versioned** — the `larsonsengine` schema version travels in the file,
   so a future build always knows what it's looking at.
2. **Readers are tolerant** — `GameProfile.fromMap` and the level loader default
   anything missing and ignore anything unknown, so a newer build never chokes
   on an old file (and an older build won't choke on a newer one — it imports
   *best-effort* rather than refusing).
3. **There's a migration hook** — on import, `GamePackage.migrate` upgrades an
   older schema to the current one. It's a no-op at v1; when the format ever
   changes, that's where a `v1 → v2` step goes.

The contract future changes must keep is intentionally small: **only add keys
(with safe defaults); never repurpose or remove one**, and when a shape must
truly change, add a migration step keyed to the version it changed at. The
`GamePackageTest` suite pins this behaviour (minimal old-shaped packages,
unknown fields, and newer-versioned packages all import), so a change that would
break an old export fails CI.

### Building a feature form

`ConfigForm` is the reusable clickable widget behind the editor and pause menu.
Each control binds to a getter/setter, so it edits your object in place:

```java
ConfigForm form = new ConfigForm("Settings");
form.addToggle("Zoom", () -> p.zoomEnabled, v -> p.zoomEnabled = v);
form.addDouble("Max zoom", () -> p.maxZoom, v -> p.maxZoom = v, 0.1, 8.0, 0.1)
    .enabledWhen(() -> p.zoomEnabled);            // greyed out + skipped when off
form.addEnum("Format", LevelFormat.values(), () -> LevelFormat.of(p.perspective),
        v -> p.perspective = v.perspective());
form.addText("Name", () -> p.name, v -> p.name = v, 40);
form.addNote("Explains the rows around it — wraps, and the selection skips it.");
form.addKeyBind(KeyBinds.active(), GameAction.JUMP);   // a rebinding row
form.addAction("Save", () -> store.save(p));
// in the scene: form.update(dt, input); form.render(g, w, h);
```

A key-bind row shows one slot box per binding; activating a slot puts the whole
form into **capture**, where the next press of any key or mouse button lands in
it. A host scene asks `form.isCapturing()` before reading input of its own, so
the key that would normally close the window goes into the binding instead —
that is all it takes to host the controls sheet anywhere (see
[Custom key binds](#custom-key-binds-rebind-anything)).

Rows lay out **control first**: the control is right-aligned in the content
column and the label gets what's left, shortened with an ellipsis if it has to
be. So a wordy label, a level name inside a cycler, or a long path typed into a
field is never drawn over the control beside it, and a text field shows the
*end* of its value (the part being typed) rather than running off the screen.
That is a backstop, not a licence to write long labels — put prose in
`addNote`, which wraps across the column at the theme's smaller note font.

## Extending the essentials

### Sprite sheets

```java
SpriteSheet sheet = SpriteSheet.load("assets/player.png", 32, 32); // frame size
Animation walk = sheet.animation(10, 0, 4, true);   // 10 fps, frames 0..3, loop
// each update:
walk.update(dt);
g.drawImage(walk.current(), x, y, null);
```

Missing images resolve to a magenta/black placeholder instead of crashing, so
you can build out art incrementally.

Sheets can also be *made* from code — or from the game, which is what
[Create texture](#create-texture-draw-the-sprite-sheet-in-game) does:

```java
SpriteCanvas canvas = new SpriteCanvas(32, 32, 6); // 32x32 frames at 6 fps
canvas.plot(4, 4, 0xffb13e53, 1);                  // ARGB pixel, 1px brush
canvas.addFrame();                                 // frame 2 = a copy of frame 1
canvas.fill(0, 0, 0xff1a1c2c);                     // flood fill the background
TexturePack.writeSheet("block/moon_rock", canvas.toSheet()); // → blocks/moon_rock.png
```

### Levels

Levels are JSON loaded from the classpath (bundled, including inside the jar) or
the filesystem. Only `tiles` is required:

```json
{
  "name": "Sample Level",
  "format": "side_scroller",
  "perspective": "SIDE_SCROLL",
  "tileSize": 32,
  "width": 24, "height": 14,
  "background": "#10141e",
  "lightAngle": 315,
  "palette": ["#785a3c", "#5aa050", "#6e6e78"],
  "spawn": { "x": 64, "y": 96 },
  "tiles": [[0,0,1,...], ...],
  "upperRle": [id, runLength, ...],
  "entities": [ { "type": "player", "x": 64, "y": 96 } ]
}
```

```java
Level level = LevelLoader.load("levels/sample_level.json");
```

`"format"` names the level's [`LevelFormat`](src/main/java/com/larsons/engine/level/LevelFormat.java)
(`side_scroller` / `3d`) — which creative mode builds it
and how it plays. `"perspective"` is the same choice in the older spelling;
either key alone is enough, and a level with neither loads as a side-scroller.
A level keeps the format it was saved with for its whole life.

`"upperRle"` (or `"upperChunks"` on a giant level) carries the **second layer
of blocks** the plan-view formats stack — see
[Stacked blocks](#stacked-blocks-the-plan-views-geometry). A side-scroller has
no such key, and neither does a 3D level written before
blocks stacked: a plan-view level with no upper layer in the file is converted
on load so it still plays as drawn.

Levels come in two modes. **Palette mode** (above, the original format):
tile ids index the colour palette and every tile is solid. **Registry mode**
(what the creative editor saves; add `"tileset": "registry"`): tile ids are
`BlockRegistry` block ids, which bring solidity, light emission, and drops.
Both load with the same `LevelLoader`, and levels serialize back with
`level.toJson()` — that round-trip is how creative saves and how a
multiplayer server hands its live, edited world to joining players.
Entity spawns take a `kind` (`"mob"` / `"item"`) resolved against the
registries:

```json
"entities": [
  { "kind": "mob",  "type": "zombie", "x": 300, "y": 128 },
  { "kind": "item", "type": "apple",  "x": 200, "y": 100 }
]
```

### Menus

```java
Menu menu = new Menu("My Game")
    .subtitle("press start")
    .theme(MenuTheme.light())              // or .dark(), or a custom MenuTheme
    .add("Play",     () -> scenes.transitionTo("play"))
    .add("Settings", () -> scenes.transitionTo("settings"))
    .add("Quit",     () -> System.exit(0));
```

Menus navigate on the player's own binds (`MENU_UP` / `MENU_DOWN` /
`MENU_SELECT` — arrows plus `W`/`S`, Enter/Space out of the box), so a rebind in
the controls screen moves every menu in the engine at once.

`MenuTheme` exposes every colour, font, and spacing value; `MenuItem` labels can
be dynamic (e.g. a "Perspective: ISOMETRIC" toggle that updates live). Menus
with more entries than fit on screen **scroll**: the mouse wheel and a draggable
scroll bar down the right edge move the view, keyboard navigation keeps the
selection visible, and a menu that fits shows no bar — so every menu screen
handles any number of entries. Titles, subtitles and items are shortened to the
window when they'd overrun it, which matters because a menu is often titled with
a name the creator typed.

### A new scene

```java
public class MyScene extends AbstractScene {
    @Override public void onEnter() { /* load */ }
    @Override public void update(double dt, InputManager input) { /* logic */ }
    @Override public void render(DrawTarget target, float alpha) { /* draw */ }
}
// register + show:
engine.scenes().register("mine", new MyScene());
engine.scenes().setScene("mine"); // or transitionTo for a fade
```

---

## Roadmap

The items below are *engine* roadmap items. For the **product** roadmap — the
path to a Steam release, phased with blockers, costs and risks — see
**[`STEAM_PLAN.md`](STEAM_PLAN.md)**. The renderer work has its own plan of
record, [`RENDER_PLAN.md`](RENDER_PLAN.md), where each step states what must be
true before it starts and the instrument that proves it worked.

- **GPU renderer backend — done.** GPU *scene* rendering is written,
  pixel-verified, selected automatically and **measured**. The `:gl` project
  holds an OpenGL 3.3 `Renderer` and a `DrawTarget` over batched vertex buffers;
  every scene in the golden catalogue renders through it within 2.59/255 of
  Java2D, and the catalogue's 3,356 drawing operations become 68 draw calls. It
  is kept out of the core so the engine itself stays JDK-only (requirement #4) —
  enforced, not assumed — and the engine finds it over `ServiceLoader`, probes
  it, and falls back to Java2D with a stated reason when there is no context. On
  an M1 MacBook Air it cut the scene stage **61%** and took the frame from over
  budget to 58–60% headroom. See
  [Rendering backends](#rendering-backends-java2d-and-opengl).
- **GPU post-processing:** running each `ShaderPass.glsl()` as real GLSL in an
  FBO ping-pong — the shader library (including `LightingPass`) needs no
  changes, by design, and every pass is already compiled and diffed against its
  CPU twin on a real driver. Deliberately scheduled *after* scene rendering:
  once the scene is drawn by GL the finished frame is already a GPU texture, so
  this follows almost for free, whereas doing it first means building a
  per-frame upload path that the scene backend then makes redundant.
- **The third axis — vertical stacking and walkable blocks.** The plan-view
  formats already have a height axis with two values: one layer of block is
  floor, two is a wall. Raising that ceiling to N, and then making the axis a
  place a body can *stand* rather than only a thing that blocks it, is what
  turns a plan view into a landscape — cliffs, terraces, towers, stairs, and a
  player who climbs them. It has its own plan of record,
  **[`HEIGHT_PLAN.md`](HEIGHT_PLAN.md)**, written the same way `RENDER_PLAN.md`
  is: every step states what must be true before it starts and the instrument
  that proves it worked. The measurement that opens it is that most of the
  pieces are already here — the wire protocol already carries an arbitrary
  layer index, `PlayerState` already has an elevation and already networks it,
  and the terrain painter already derives visible faces from the projection
  rather than from the heading — and that the one genuinely missing thing is
  that a body's floor is the literal number zero, everywhere.
- **The run that survives the session — done.** The engine used to persist the
  *world* and never the *run*: `PlayScene.onEnter` built a fresh `PlayerStats`,
  a fresh `Inventory` and a `PlayerState` at the level's spawn every single
  time, so inventory, health, position, the character you chose and every
  stat-rule counter went on exit, with no prompt and no slot to put them in. The
  pause menu's *Save Level* saved the mountain you dug and lost the diamonds you
  dug out of it — and wrote back over the level's *authored* copy while doing
  it. There is a **save file** now: `Continue` on the main menu, three run slots
  per game type, *Save Run* / *Save and Quit* in the pause menu, a quit that
  asks before throwing an hour away, and an autosave at every door, every death
  and every couple of minutes. A run is `saves/<game-type>/<slot>/`, holding a
  `run.json` and the run's own copies of every level it has changed — **a save
  slot is a second levels root**, so authored levels became read-only on the
  play path and a new run really does start from the level as its author built
  it. Doors write before they read, so a game type of linked levels is the one
  continuous world it was always described as, and one-shot stat rules stay
  one-shot — walking out and back used to re-arm every reward in the level.
  Saving is off the game thread: the snapshot is taken where the game runs and
  the 6–125 ms of string building is not, and an untouched level is not written
  at all. See **[`SAVE_PLAN.md`](SAVE_PLAN.md)** for the evidence, the six jobs,
  and §12 on what the build taught that the plan did not know.
- **Player settings are the player's — done.** Volume used to live on
  `GameProfile`, be captured into every level file, and be copied back out on
  load, so opening someone else's level replaced your mix with theirs and a door
  between two levels could change it mid-run. It lives in `config/player.json`
  now, beside the key binds and under the same rule, along with mouse-look
  sensitivity, an invert-Y toggle and a HUD scale — reachable from a new
  **Options** entry in the pause menu, which is the first place in the engine a
  *player* rather than an *author* can change how the game feels.
- **Netcode next steps:** interest management for large worlds, lag
  compensation for hit detection.
- **Deeper ports from the Side-Scroller engine:** alchemy/crafting recipes,
  vault storage, equipment overlays, moving blocks, doors/buttons/triggers —
  the registries and the request protocol are the hooks they'd plug into
  (projectiles + ranged weapons and server-side eat/consume shipped with the
  inventory/projectile update).

covering JSON read/write, level loading (both tile modes + round-trips),
sprite-sheet slicing, input edge detection, custom key binds (what ships
bound, binding tokens round-tripping through the saved file, keys and mouse
buttons outside the usual range being tracked and bindable, modifier
combinations only firing while held, conflicts reported inside a group but not
across them, and the controls form capturing, cancelling and clearing a
binding), game-type save/load, the
`ConfigForm` widget's keyboard/mouse interaction (including scrolling),
rendering the scenes off-screen (play + creative), pixel-exact shader
behavior + the GLSL contract and export (including the lighting pass),
deterministic player physics, the mob AI state machine, world simulation
(mining → drops → pickup, melee combat, the day/night curve),
melee combat (every move's wind-up → active → recovery phases and the rule
that a swing lands exactly once; per-move cooldowns and stamina; the styles
every existing item derives and the two ways a game type overrides them;
weapon reach and arc deciding what a strike catches; a guard soaking its
share, a parry catching a blow outright and turning shots around, dash frames
avoiding one; a committed burst carrying a fighter and letting go; armed mobs
inheriting their weapon's timings, winding up before they land, and catching a
player's swing; the stance and the mob's move riding the wire; and the sheet
and sound chains — a held object's wielder art, the object's own art, both
falling back to idle, and the move sheet playing exactly once across the
move), projectiles
(registry + item links, ammo consumption, gravity arcs vs straight magic,
mob hits, explosions with area damage, recoverable drops, toggle gating),
inventory primitives (move/merge/swap/removeAt), per-game-type level saving,
the creative/engine feature set (giant chunked levels with lazy
deterministic generation and edited-chunk-only saves, AABB wall/ceiling
collisions, sprint stamina, block durability with tool speed-ups, crafting
and smelting recipes, mana-costed magic, stat rules firing rewards and
consumptions, brush footprints, mob wall-hopping, surface-decor and
stat-rule serialization, and the creative scene rendering off-screen),
creative mode's undo (a step grouping a whole action and undoing its parts in
reverse; an action that changed nothing leaving no step to press through;
overlapping saves of one cell resolving to the state before the stroke;
nested steps counting as one action; a new edit dropping what redo would have
put back; the bound forgetting the oldest first; an undo that cannot record a
step of its own; cell snapshots bringing back a stack with its details and its
container; document snapshots restoring markers, rules, cutscenes edited in
place, the mini game and the roster, and comparing equal when nothing changed;
resize snapshots restoring dropped content and the dense grid a giant resize
converted away; a level swap handing back the very level that was open; and
Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y driven through the real editor with synthesized clicks and
keystrokes — a whole drag taken back at once, an erased block and the detail
that hung off it coming back in order, a painted marker unplaced and placed
again, and Ctrl+Z with nothing to undo leaving the level alone),
sound (the MP3 decoder against streams it builds itself — frames, ID3v1/v2
tags, resynchronisation past damage, and every truncation and random-byte
case a half-written file can produce; the packed Huffman code books walked
for structural integrity, since a mistyped digit there would corrupt audio
silently rather than fail; the sound pack's name-based lookup with its
specific-beats-general fallback and its liquids/lights folders; the rule that
everything defaults to silence except the actions that always had a voice;
per-sound overrides round-tripping through `soundpack.json` and `sounds.json`;
the fresh-pitch drift staying inside its bound while never repeating, and
never touching music; the whole system being a no-op with no audio device;
objects made with the "+" button arriving with a full set of action states in
the generated key list; and the creative sound menu driven by clicking it),
the in-game sprite-sheet editor (pencil, flood fill, line and rectangle
coverage; a drag interpolated into a stroke rather than dots; a new frame
starting as a copy of the one before it while leaving that one alone; the
last frame cleared rather than deleted away; whole-stroke undo, including
across a canvas resize; the exported sheet slicing back into exactly the
frames it was drawn as; painting, right-click erasing and `Ctrl+S` driven
through the real window with synthesized mouse and key events; and the saved
sheet landing in the texture pack under the object's own file name, at the
frame rate it was drawn at, drawing immediately),
cutscenes ([`CutsceneTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/CutsceneTest.java):
sheet-anim frame timing with loop/one-shot clamping, the step player's
sequencing — captions, moves with walk-state restore and facing, camera
pans, skipping applying every remaining effect — the trigger director's
zone/interact/level-start semantics with once-per-run and re-arming, and
level-JSON round-trips),
the expanded menagerie (ranged mobs whose shots hurt players but never other
mobs, summoners, splitters, death-bursts, blinks, regen/lifesteal/shield,
elemental burn/chill/poison/chain statuses and their wire bits, essence
loot), relics and elemental weapons (passives flowing from inventory to
physics — speed, slow fall, flight, magnetism, melee power — the Phoenix
Feather revive, Nova/Tremor actives, bombs cratering terrain under the
editing toggle, the Harvest Orb, the Warp Staff's owner-teleport, meteor
salvos and the Scatter Bow, and recipe-catalog integrity), vehicles (item
links, mount validation, gallop/jump physics, buoyant boats, flying
carpets, the terrain-grinding drill, dragon fire, pack-up recovery, wire
form — plus a full online ride: mount request, replicated gallop with the
rider glued to the saddle, dismount),
characters and their signature moves (the eight-point compass and its
side-scroll two, per-facing sprite resolution with mirrored twins and the
pre-generated fallback nobody flips, per-direction pack file names,
character-profile persistence and re-registration per game type, trait
clamping, level rosters saving and degrading gracefully when a profile is
deleted, traits actually reaching the physics — speed, sprint permission, air
jumps, jump height, resized pools — ultimate charging from time and damage,
one-cast spending, every ability's effect in both perspectives, sustained
buffs lapsing on their own and on death, particle and projectile texture keys
with their built-in fallbacks, a skinned particle sheet actually rendering,
and jumping in both formats: Space off the ground in side-scroll, the
plan-view hop's launch/peak/landing, its mid-air steering and double jump, the
jump/fall animation states it drives, and the Z axis parking when a door leads
into a side-scrolling level),
the per-format physical spaces (which axis each one calls up, that gravity
turns rather than switching off, and how height draws in each; that `W`/`Up`
jump nothing — on foot or on a mount — while Space still does; meteor salvos
spawning above the aim point on a plane and landing on the tile they were
aimed at, still arriving from up the screen in a side-scroller, and a falling
shot clearing walls until it touches down; particle trajectories rising up the
screen instead of spraying north-east and splashing across the
floor instead of running south, with the side-scroller's own motion unchanged;
knockback following the hit vector on a plane; thrown stacks leaving along all
eight facings),
and full loopback multiplayer (a real server + clients: handshake, movement,
join/leave, version rejection, shutdown — plus block edits replicating to
every client and late joiners, painted mobs appearing in snapshots and being
erased, pickups landing in the server-side inventory, feature toggles gating
edits server-side, shots consuming server-side ammo and replicating with
impact-fx broadcasts, inventory move/drop/eat requests, and placement
consuming block items) — so everything is verifiable without a display.

The auto-battler is covered the same way: registry integrity (every trait
tier reachable, every component pair combining), pool scarcity + shop odds,
buy/combine/sell round-trips, placement rules, the economy, deterministic
seeded battles, whole bot games running headlessly to a winner (PvE rounds,
ghosts, eliminations, placements), real loopback lobbies with host-only
controls and combat replication, and both scenes rendering off-screen
against a live server.

Evolution is covered end to end from the genetics up:
[`GenomeTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/evolution/GenomeTest.java)
pins the decoding rules themselves (the design's worked example — a green in
slot 3 is light emission of 3, doubled by a following red — the whole
wild-card wheel and its wrap-around, all nine pair abilities, the long-strand
unlockables, colour and shape derivation, and that replication miscopies often
enough to explore while still letting a faithful long strand breed true);
[`EvolutionGameTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/evolution/EvolutionGameTest.java)
runs the ecology headlessly (the opening state the design specifies,
replication and divergence, starvation ending a run, energy-neutral corpse
recycling, digestion waste, complex energy gated on the ability that eats it,
predators actually killing, barriers and dish walls holding, heat diffusing,
shadows and spotlights, the shop, the spatula spending only on a real
transfer, catalog uniqueness and colony combinations) and the JSON layer (save
round-trips, one file per discovery, the book outliving a new experiment, and
corrupt or junk-bearing saves being reported rather than thrown, the two
discovery tiers round-tripping separately, a full reset clearing the game
catalog and the balance while the history keeps every organism, achievement and
lifetime total across repeated resets, an older layout's discoveries being
migrated rather than stranded, and the tuning invariants that keep red the
hardest opening); and
[`EvolutionSceneTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/EvolutionSceneTest.java)
renders every screen off-screen against a live dish — lobby, microscope, shop,
help, pause, and both pages of the reference book — and drives the tool tray
and inspector by synthesized clicks.

The presentation/customization layer has its own suite:
[`AutoBattlerFxTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/autobattler/AutoBattlerFxTest.java)
(replicated animation states, damage-by-type tallies, source-carrying combat
events, board-scouting requests — including for eliminated spectators),
[`AutoBattlerScoutTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/AutoBattlerScoutTest.java)
(clicking a standings row scouts a live server's board end to end),
[`SkinsTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/SkinsTest.java) (skin
definitions, the 0-120 fps clamp, store round-trips, sheet slicing and
fallbacks), [`AutoHudTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/demo/AutoHudTest.java)
(HUD text regions stay pairwise disjoint across window sizes and fill
levels), [`ShareJarTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/ShareJarTest.java)
(the auto-built share jar is runnable, scripted, documented, carries a
texture pack, isn't rebuilt needlessly — and is only built inside IntelliJ,
including when its Gradle fork strips the IDE's markers),
and [`TexturePackTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/TexturePackTest.java)
(the drop-in folder scaffolds itself, finds sheets by palette-category file
name, plays them at one universal spec that any single texture can override,
lets each object opt out or point elsewhere, and keeps palette icons showing
the texture that actually renders).

Infinite terrain has its own suite,
[`InfiniteTerrainTest`](src/test/java/com/larsons/engine/InfiniteTerrainTest.java),
which pins the four things a generated world would otherwise be quietly wrong
about: **determinism** (a chunk built twice is the same chunk, two generators on
one seed are the same world, and a tree that straddles a chunk boundary comes out
whole whichever side is built first — chunks are dropped and rebuilt behind the
player, so a column that came back different would be a world rearranging
itself); **the vertical layout** (land at 150 and above, sea water never above
149, a biome aiming anywhere in the 0–512 height axis, and a world varied enough
that most of the biome list actually appears and the palette runs to sixty-odd
blocks); **what a save costs** (the seed, the visited list and the edited chunks
round-trip, pristine ground rebuilds from the seed rather than from the file,
turning generation off keeps the explored ground and stops at its edge, and
retuning a biome or typing a new seed regrows the ground while what was built on
it stays put); and **the sweep bounds** (a buried column is skipped, nothing with
an empty neighbour is ever left off the list, an ordinary level still sweeps
every layer, and the coarse horizon answers without generating the ground it
describes). Plus the settings themselves — the sliders reaching 192 and 2048,
biomes and terrain settings round-tripping through a level file, the `+` button
producing a working biome, a world of one invented biome being made of it, a
disabled biome not being generated, and a level saved before any of this existed
still loading as a level.
