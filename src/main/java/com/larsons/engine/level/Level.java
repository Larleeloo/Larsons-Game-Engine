/**
 * In-memory representation of a loaded level (requirement #6: level loading).
 *
 * <p>A level is a grid of integer tile ids ({@code 0} = empty) plus metadata.
 * Tiles resolve in one of two modes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Registry mode</b> (levels written by the creative editor, marked
 *       {@code "tileset": "registry"}): ids are {@link Block} ids from a
 *       {@link BlockRegistry}, which supplies colour, solidity, light
 *       emission, and drops. This is the block system ported from the
 *       Side-Scroller engine.</li>
 *   <li><b>Palette mode</b> (legacy levels): ids index a colour palette and
 *       every non-empty tile is solid — exactly the original minimal
 *       behaviour, so old levels load unchanged.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Levels are mutable ({@link #setTile}) because the creative editor paints
 * into them and multiplayer block edits apply to them, and they serialize back
 * to JSON ({@link #toJson}) so edited worlds can be saved and sent to joining
 * players.

     * <p><b>Why height belongs in this.</b> A chunk is a column of world, and

     * it: standing on a plateau you can see for a hundred tiles, and sixty
     * blocks down a mine shaft you can see the four walls of the shaft. The
     * radius was the render distance in both cases, so a player who dug down
     * went on generating — and, with {@code saveExplored} on, went on
     * <em>storing</em> — a disc of surface world a hundred and twenty tiles
     * across that they could not see a single block of.
     *
     * <p>So being under the local ground shrinks the ring, in proportion, down
     * to the handful of chunks the body itself needs to collide with. It is the
     * streaming half of the same argument the renderer's line-of-sight cull
     * makes ({@code SolidPainter.terrain}), and the two agree by construction:
     * what the eye cannot see is what the world need not build.
     *
     * <p>Being <em>above</em> the ground does not grow it. A player on a tower
     * can see further, but what is drawn is still bounded by the render
     * distance, so a wider ring would build ground nothing is going to ask for.
     *
     * @param worldZ how high the player is above the floor, or {@code NaN} when
     *               the caller has no height to offer (a flat camera, an

     * visible cells, which is 15% of a 60 Hz budget spent discovering that the

     * <p><b>Why this is a cache and {@code stackHeight} is not.</b> Appendix B

     * right to: it measured {@code stackHeight} at 0.14 ms over a whole 256²

     * write bought nothing. That measurement is linear in the layer ceiling and
     * was taken when the ceiling was eight. At 512 the same sweep is 9 ms. The
     * decision is reversed on the arithmetic that made it, not against it.
     *
     * <p><b>Why it cannot go stale low, which is the only direction that
     * matters.</b> Too high costs a few empty layers of walking; too low drops
     * geometry off the screen. So every way the terrain can change either

     * touch, because a level has millions of cells and a stroke touches a
     * handful.

     * <p>It is the whole cell rather than a tile id because clearing a cell's

     * a column is eight deep now. Undo that restored two layers of a five-deep
     * tower would be a corruption bug wearing an editor bug's clothes: the
     * stroke would come back looking undone and the cell would be three blocks
     * shorter than it started.
