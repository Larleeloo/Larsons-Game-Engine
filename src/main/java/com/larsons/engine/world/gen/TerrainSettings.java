/**
 * A level's procedural-terrain settings: whether the world beyond the level's
 * own bounds generates itself, what it generates from, and how far the player
 * can see it.
 *
 * <p>These live on the level's {@link com.larsons.engine.config.GameProfile},
 * which is to say <b>per level</b> and edited in the same settings menu as
 * everything else the level plays with. A game type can hold a hand-built maze
 * beside an endless overworld, and neither one has to know about the other.
 *
 * <p><b>What "infinite" means here.</b> Turning {@link #enabled} on expands the
 * level into a world {@link #worldSize} tiles on a side — 16&nbsp;384 by
 * default, half a million blocks across at the standard tile size — and hands
 * everything outside the level's authored bounds to
 * {@link WorldGenerator}. Nothing is built up front: a column of the world
 * exists the first time something looks at it, and columns nobody has looked at
 * cost nothing at all (see {@link WorldTerrain}). It is not literally
 * unbounded, because a coordinate has to fit in an {@code int} and a save file
 * has to name a cell; it is unbounded in the sense that matters, which is that
 * no player will reach the edge.
 *
 * <p><b>What turning it off does.</b> Generation stops and the world stops
 * growing, but what has already been walked through is kept: explored chunks
 * are promoted to saved chunks, so the level keeps exactly the terrain that has
 * been seen and nothing else. That is the difference between a setting and a
 * demolition — a creator who explores a valley they like can freeze it and
 * carry on building by hand.
