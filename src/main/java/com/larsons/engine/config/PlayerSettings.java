/**
 * The settings that belong to <em>the person playing</em>, as opposed to the
 * ones that belong to a game type or a level.
 *
 * <p>{@link com.larsons.engine.input.KeyBinds} already drew this line and drew
 * it correctly — "binds are a property of the person playing, not of a game
 * type, so there is a single file rather than one per profile". Audio never
 * got the same treatment: volume lived on {@link GameProfile}, which
 * {@code captureSettings} writes into every level file and
 * {@link GameProfile#applyFeaturesFrom} copies back out on load. The
 * consequence was that opening a level someone else authored replaced your
 * volume with theirs, and walking through a door between two levels saved at
 * different volumes changed the mix under you mid-run. Volume lives here now,
 * beside the two look settings that were previously constants in the play
 * scene and the HUD scale that was previously nothing at all.
 *
 * <p>The test for whether something belongs in this class is simple: <b>would
 * a player be annoyed if loading someone else's level changed it?</b> Volume,
 * mouse sensitivity, an inverted Y axis and HUD size all pass. Whether the
 * game has a day/night cycle does not — that is the level's business, and it
 * stays on {@link GameProfile}.
 *
 * <p>One deliberate omission: {@link GameProfile#soundPitchVariation} stays
 * with the game type. Slight per-play pitch drift is a stylistic decision a
 * creator makes about how their game sounds, not a comfort setting a player
 * makes about their own machine.
