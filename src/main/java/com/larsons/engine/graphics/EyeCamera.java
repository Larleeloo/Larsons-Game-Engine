/**
 * A camera that stands <em>in</em> the world at an eye and looks along a
 * heading — the pinhole projection the first- and third-person views are drawn
 * through.
 *
 * <p><b>How this differs from {@link Camera}, which is the other camera in this
 * package.</b> {@code Camera} hangs over the world and flattens it: its
 * projection is <em>parallel</em>, so a block a hundred tiles away is drawn
 * exactly as large as the one under your feet, and its "position" is a point on
 * the world plane that lands in the middle of the screen. This one has a
 * position in three dimensions, a direction it faces, and a field of view, and
 * it divides by depth. That division is the whole of what makes a picture read
 * as 3D: parallel lines converge, a corridor narrows, and walking forward makes
 * things grow.
 *
 * <p>They are separate classes rather than one camera with a mode because they
 * share nothing but a viewport. The flat camera's whole design — a pixel
 * lattice the camera cannot move, an eight-point heading that snaps to exact
 * axis swaps, a terrain cache that bakes chunks only at those headings — exists
 * to make a <em>parallel</em> projection stop shimmering, and none of it means
 * anything once there is a perspective divide. Folding this into it would have
 * put a branch through every one of those decisions.
 *
 * <h2>Axes, and which way is which</h2>
 *
 * <p>The world plane is the one the rest of the engine uses: {@code +x} east,
 * {@code +y} south, so north is {@code -y}. Height is {@code z}, zero on the
 * floor and rising, in the same world units as {@code x} and {@code y} — one
 * block is {@code Level.tileSize} on every axis (see {@code Level.BLOCK_HEIGHT},
 * which is what makes that true).
 *
 * <p>{@link #yaw()} is the compass heading the eye faces, radians clockwise
 * from north — <b>the same convention {@link Camera#yaw()} uses</b>, so a
 * heading can be handed from one camera to the other when the player toggles
 * between the views and mean the same direction. Forward is therefore
 * {@code (sin yaw, -cos yaw)} and right is {@code (cos yaw, sin yaw)}.
 *
 * <p>{@link #pitch()} is how far the eye is tilted off the horizontal, radians,
 * <b>positive looking up</b>. Bounded at just under a quarter turn by
 * {@link #MAX_PITCH}: straight up and straight down are where the yaw axis and
 * the view axis line up and a heading stops meaning anything, which is why
 * every game that has ever had a mouse-look stops just short of them.
 *
 * <h2>The projection</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two rotations and a divide. A world point is taken relative to the eye,
 * turned by the yaw onto {@code (right, forward)}, tilted by the pitch onto
 * {@code (high, depth)}, and then divided:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   screenX = centreX + right * focal / depth
 *   screenY = centreY - high  * focal / depth
 *   focal   = (viewportHeight / 2) / tan(fov / 2)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>{@code depth} is distance along the view axis, and it is the number
 * everything else here is about: it is what the divide needs to be positive
 * for, what {@link #clipNear} exists to guarantee, and what a painter sorts
 * on.
 *
 * <p><b>Why {@code focal} is measured against the viewport's height.</b> The
 * field of view given to {@link #setFov} is the <em>vertical</em> one, so
 * widening the window widens what you can see rather than stretching what was
 * already there. Deriving it from the width instead is the classic way to give
 * a wide monitor a fish-eye and a narrow one a keyhole.
