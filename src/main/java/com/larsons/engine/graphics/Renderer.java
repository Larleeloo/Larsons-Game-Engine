/**
 * Rendering backend abstraction.
 *
 * <p>The default backend ({@link Java2DRenderer}) draws with the JDK's Java2D
 * pipeline. That is what lets the engine run out of the box on any machine with
 * a JRE (requirement #4) — no native libraries, no GPU bindings.
 *
 * <p><b>A second implementation is chosen at startup when one is available.</b>
 * {@link Backends} probes the classpath for a {@link RendererFactory} and uses
 * what it finds, falling back here with a stated reason when there is nothing to
 * find or nothing that works. The engine cannot name a backend outside its own
 * jar and does not try to: see {@link RendererFactory} for why that indirection
 * is structural. A backend from outside also brings its own
 * {@link BackendWindow}, because the engine's is an AWT canvas that only
 * {@link Java2DRenderer} can draw into.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing about this interface names Java2D.</b> {@link #beginFrame()}
 * hands back a {@link DrawTarget}, so a frame is a sequence of backend-neutral
 * drawing verbs from the moment it is acquired to the moment it is presented.
 * That was not true until B4: it used to return a {@code Graphics2D}, which
 * meant every scene in the engine was handed the CPU renderer by the loop
 * itself, and a GPU backend could not be written without changing the loop.
 * Now a backend is free to return a target that appends to a vertex buffer,
 * and neither {@code Engine} nor any scene can tell.
 *
 * <p><b>Shader support (requirement #5) lives behind this seam too, and both
 * halves of it now exist.</b> Every backend honours a {@link ShaderChain} of
 * post-processing passes. Each
 * {@link com.larsons.engine.graphics.shader.ShaderPass} is defined GLSL-first
 * (real GPU fragment shader source) with a semantically identical CPU
 * implementation. {@link Java2DRenderer} runs the CPU side in parallel row
 * stripes; the GL backend compiles each pass's {@code glsl()} once and runs it
 * as a framebuffer ping-pong over the scene texture, with the same passes in
 * the same order and no per-effect porting. Neither the loop's
 * {@code beginFrame() -> draw -> present()} lifecycle nor any pass changed to
 * make that true — which is the claim the GLSL-first design was making, and it
 * has now been cashed rather than asserted.
 *
 * <p>The two are held to each other by measurement, not by intent:
 * {@code GlShaderChainTest} renders every pass both ways and subtracts, and
 * reproduces the same per-pass errors {@code ShaderParityTest} recorded of the
 * shaders before any backend existed — five passes at 0.00 out of 255,
 * {@code scanlines} 0.04, {@code vignette} 0.32, {@code grayscale} 0.47,
 * {@code bloom} 3.58.

     * than either.</b> A profile from an M1 Air with vsync on measured
     * {@code present} at a p99 of <b>16.752 ms</b> — one refresh period at
     * 60 Hz, so the swap really was blocking — and {@code idle} at a p50 of
     * <b>11.975 ms</b> on top, which is the software limiter waiting for a
     * deadline of its own. Frame time came out at 21.5 ms against a 16.67 ms
     * budget: the loop was running at <b>46 FPS while asking for 60</b>, and
     * the frames it did deliver landed at whatever phase the two schedules
     * happened to be in. A rigidly-drawn world delivered at uneven times looks
     * like a world that is not rigid, which is what a player calls a shimmer.
     *
     * <p>The mechanism is worth stating because it is not obvious that two
     * correct pacers compose badly. The limiter schedules on an absolute
     * timeline from {@code System.nanoTime}; the display refreshes on its own,
     * unrelated one. Whenever the limiter's deadline falls just after a refresh
     * boundary, that frame's swap misses the boundary and blocks for a whole
     * further period — so the loop alternates between one refresh and two, and
     * the apparent motion of everything on screen alternates with it.
     *
     * <p>Default {@code false}, which is right for every backend that presents
     * without waiting: the limiter is then the only thing pacing frames, which
     * is what it was written to be.
