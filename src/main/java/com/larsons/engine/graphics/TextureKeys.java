/**
 * The catalogue behind the drop-in texture pack: every skinnable object the
 * engine knows about, and the file name a {@link TexturePack} expects for it.
 *
 * <p>A texture key ({@code block/dirt}, {@code mob/slime/idle}) maps to a
 * folder named after the palette category it is painted from and a file named
 * after the object, so a pack is filled in by name alone — no config editing:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   block/dirt          -&gt; blocks/dirt.png
 *   block/water         -&gt; liquids/water.png   (a liquid; blocks/water.png also works)
 *   mob/slime/walk      -&gt; mobs/slime_walk.png (or mobs/slime.png for every state)
 *   mob/slime/walk/e    -&gt; mobs/slime_walk_e.png  (walking east; falls back to the above)
 *   item/iron_sword     -&gt; items/iron_sword.png
 *   surface/moss        -&gt; block_decor/moss.png
 *   player/idle         -&gt; player/idle.png
 *   player/walk/ne      -&gt; player/walk_ne.png   (walking north-east)
 *   character/rogue/walk-&gt; player/rogue_walk.png (a character profile's sheet)
 *   particle/embers     -&gt; particles/embers.png
 *   projectile/arrow    -&gt; projectiles/arrow.png
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Keys nest from general to specific, and a missing sheet falls back one
 * segment at a time: {@code mob/slime/walk/e} tries {@code mobs/slime_walk_e},
 * then {@code mobs/slime_walk}, then {@code mobs/slime}. That is what lets one
 * file reskin a whole mob while a creator who wants per-direction art just
 * adds more files.
 *
 * <p>{@link #paths} lists the relative paths a key accepts, most specific
 * first; {@link #all} enumerates the whole catalogue so the pack can ship a
 * {@code TEXTURE_KEYS.txt} listing every name a creator can use — including
 * the custom blocks/mobs/items they added to their own game type, since those
 * register into the same registries.
