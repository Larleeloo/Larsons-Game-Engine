/**
 * Everything the engine can draw, named without reference to how it is drawn.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> Scenes currently draw by calling
 * {@link java.awt.Graphics2D} directly — about nine hundred call sites across
 * forty-three files. Graphics2D is an immediate-mode API bound to Java2D, so
 * every one of those calls is both a drawing instruction and a commitment to
 * the CPU renderer. Profiling says scene drawing is what costs (15.4 ms of a
 * 22 ms frame on an M1 Air), which makes a GPU scene renderer the work worth
 * doing — and it cannot begin while the instructions and the renderer are the
 * same thing.
 *
 * <p>So this is the seam. It names the drawing operations the engine actually
 * performs, and nothing else. {@link Java2DTarget} implements it over
 * Graphics2D, so today's renderer keeps working unchanged; a GL backend
 * implements the same verbs by appending to vertex buffers and flushing on
 * state change. Painters written against this interface do not know or care
 * which they are talking to.
 *
 * <p><b>Deliberately small, and sized by measurement.</b> The verbs here were
 * chosen by counting what the engine really calls rather than by mirroring
 * Graphics2D. A wide surface is a wide GL backend, and every verb added is a
 * verb that has to be batched, tested and kept consistent across backends.
 * Anything expressible as a combination of these is left to the caller.
 *
 * <p>The first cut covered what the <em>world</em> draws. The UI draws
 * different things, so B1 counted those too and added exactly what the count
 * demanded: rounded rectangles (161 fills, 82 outlines — the most-used shape
 * in the engine), arcs (32 sites, all cooldown rings and radial meters),
 * gradients (12 linear, 6 radial), and dashed lines. Nothing was added on the
 * grounds that a drawing API "ought to" have it. Two things the audit
 * explicitly declined to add are recorded on {@link #drawDashedLine} (caps and
 * joins) and in {@link #pushAlpha} (non-{@code SRC_OVER} composites).
 *
 * <p><b>Integer coordinates.</b> The call sites this replaces are integer
 * pixel work, and matching them exactly is what lets the Java2D
 * implementation be a refactor with no visual change at all — the property
 * that makes this migration safe to do a painter at a time. A GL backend
 * widens to float on the way into its vertex buffer, which costs nothing. The
 * one exception is {@link #drawImage(BufferedImage, AffineTransform)}, because
 * an isometric tile is a sheared parallelogram and there is no integer form
 * of that.
 *
 * <p><b>Colours are packed {@code 0xAARRGGBB} ints</b> — the layout of a
 * {@code BufferedImage} raster and of the shader pipeline, and free of
 * allocation on a path that runs thousands of times a frame. {@link Color}
 * overloads exist so migrating a call site stays a one-line mechanical change.
 *
 * <p><b>State is a stack, not a setting.</b> Graphics2D lets a caller set a
 * clip or a composite and leave it set, which works only because every drawing
 * call is immediate. A batching backend reorders work, so state has to be
 * scoped: push it, draw, pop it. Every {@code push} has exactly one
 * {@code pop}, and implementations may assume it.
