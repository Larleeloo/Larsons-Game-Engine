/**
 * Draws a level's blocks as solid cubes seen through an {@link EyeCamera} —
 * the picture behind the first- and third-person {@link Viewpoint}s.
 *
 * <p><b>What this is, next to {@link TerrainPainter}.</b> That painter draws
 * the same blocks through the flat {@link Camera}: a floor of quads with the
 * stacked columns extruded up the screen, which is the right picture for a plan
 * view and is what every level in this engine was authored through. This one
 * draws the same volume from inside it. The level's data is unchanged and no
 * geometry is duplicated — a column is still a column — but every face is
 * projected individually and divided by its own depth, so a corridor narrows
 * and a wall you walk toward grows. That divide is the only real difference,
 * and it is the whole of why the result reads like Minecraft rather than like a
 * plan view zoomed in.
 *
 * <h2>How a frame is built</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #begin} paints the sky and empties the queue.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #terrain} sweeps the cells within the view distance and queues
 *       every block face that is <em>exposed</em> (a neighbour does not cover
 *       it) and <em>turned toward the eye</em>.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #billboard} queues an actor — drawn by the scene's ordinary 2D
 *       sprite code, under a transform; see that method.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #flush} sorts the queue far-to-near and draws it.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Two culls, and why neither is a heuristic</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Face exposure.</b> A face with a solid block against it can never be
 * seen, so it is never queued. This is what makes the sweep affordable: a
 * hillside of ten thousand blocks has a few hundred exposed faces, and the
 * ninety-odd percent that are buried cost one array read each to reject.
 *
 * <p><b>Back-facing.</b> Of the six faces of a box, the eye can see only those
 * whose outward normal points at it, and for an axis-aligned box that is a
 * comparison rather than a dot product: the top is visible when the eye is
 * above it, the north face when the eye is north of it. Both culls together
 * mean nothing hidden is ever projected.
 *
 * <h2>Depth, without a depth buffer</h2>
 *
 * <p>Requirement #4 says the JDK-only build is the one that must work, and
 * Java2D has no depth buffer — so this is a painter's algorithm, like every
 * other pass in the engine. What it sorts on is <b>how many cells away from the
 * eye's own cell a face's cell is</b>, counted along the three axes
 * ({@link #cellOrder}).
 *
 * <p>That is exact rather than approximate, and the argument is three lines
 * long: along any straight ray each coordinate moves monotonically, so the sum
 * of the three cell distances never decreases along it; so a face hit before
 * another has a sum no larger; so drawing in decreasing order of that sum puts
 * every occluder over what it occludes. Two faces that tie cannot occlude each
 * other, because no ray reaches both.
 *
 * <p>It rests on one thing: <b>a face belongs to exactly one cell</b>. That is
 * why side faces are drawn per block rather than merged up a column — see
 * {@link #block}. Sorting merged runs by their nearest corner was the previous
 * scheme, and it is wrong in exactly the case players report: a tall wall whose
 * nearest corner is at your elbow drawn over the block standing halfway along
 * it.
 *
 * <h2>Texture, and the shade baked into it</h2>
 *
 * <p>A face is drawn with the block's own sheet — the same
 * {@link TextureKeys#BLOCKS_TOP top} and {@link TextureKeys#BLOCKS_SIDE side}
 * pools the plan view resolves, with the same fallbacks — mapped onto the
 * projected quad in <b>patches</b>, each one small enough that an affine blit
 * covers it: see {@link #drawTextured}. One affine map over a whole face is
 * what a player sees as the surface bending and folding, because three corners
 * decide such a map and the divide puts the fourth somewhere else entirely;
 * halving a face until each piece is nearly a parallelogram costs a handful of
 * blits on the tiles underfoot and one on everything else. The same halving is
 * what carries a texture onto the face you are standing <em>against</em>: a
 * patch with a corner behind your own eye cannot be projected, so it is cut
 * down until the part that can be is, rather than the face giving up its
 * texture — which is what it used to do, and always on the nearest face in the
 * frame. Faces a few pixels across keep the flat fill: at that size a sheet is
 * a smear of its own average colour, which is what the fill is.
 *
 * <p>Shading is the classic four-level scheme every blocky 3D game uses: the
 * top brightest, north/south next, east/west darker, the underside darkest,
 * which is what makes a cube read as a cube without a single light calculation.
 * On a textured face it is baked into the sheet ({@link SolidTextures}) rather
 * than washed over it, so no face is ever drawn twice to be lit.
 *
 * <p><b>What it costs.</b> Nine milliseconds a frame at 1280&times;720 against
 * two and a half for the same view untextured, measured over an open plain at
 * eye level — which is this pass's worst case rather than its average, since
 * every face in it is floor seen at a glancing angle and floor at a glancing
 * angle is the only thing that needs many patches. It is Java2D's warped blit
 * that costs it, near enough in proportion to the pixels covered, so the
 * tolerance below buys quality far more cheaply than it looks like it should.

     * <ul>
     *   <li><b>The frustum</b> ({@link EyeCamera#boxVisible}). A screen is a
     *       wedge of the disc and not the disc — about a quarter of it at an
     *       ordinary field of view — and this used to be a half-space test
     *       against the heading, which keeps everything <em>beside</em> you as
     *       well as everything in front. Four exact planes drop three cells in
     *       four before anything about their contents is read.</li>
     *   <li><b>Line of sight</b> ({@link #hiddenBehindHorizon}). A column of
     *       ground standing between the eye and a cell hides that cell, and a
     *       heightfield says so without tracing anything: sweep outward, and
     *       remember for each direction how high the terrain has already
     *       reached. Everything behind and below that line is not drawn. Inside
     *       a room it removes the world outside the walls; in mountains it
     *       removes the far side of the ridge; on an open plain it removes
     *       nothing, correctly, because on an open plain you can see the
     *       plain.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>What the two are worth.</b> Over generated terrain at
     * 1280&times;720, measured: 12&nbsp;ms a frame becomes 9 at the default
     * render distance of twenty tiles, 60 becomes 20 at sixty-four, 256 becomes
     * 34 at a hundred and twenty-eight, and 688&nbsp;ms becomes 47 at the
     * slider's own ceiling of a hundred and ninety-two. The far end of that is
     * the point: a long render distance used to be a setting that could not be
     * used, and what it costs now grows with how much of the world can be seen
     * rather than with the area of the disc.
     *
     * <p><b>Which is why the sweep runs in rings.</b> Line of sight is only
     * sound if a cell is tested against occluders that are actually in front of
     * it, so the cells are visited nearest first — squares of growing radius
     * about the eye's own cell, rather than the rows of a rectangle. Chebyshev
     * rings are only approximately sorted by distance (a ring's corner is
     * further than the next ring's edge), so the horizon also remembers how far
     * away the column that set it was, and a cell nearer than that is drawn

     * the detail radius, and everything past it costs a few thousand quads
     * whatever the number says.
     *
     * <p><b>What is drawn.</b> One box per square group of cells, standing on
     * the floor, as tall as the tallest column in the group and in that
     * column's own colour: a hill reads as a hill and a wall as a wall, for a
     * few hundred flat quads over the whole horizon rather than the hundred
     * thousand block faces the detailed sweep would queue at that range. No
     * textures — a 32-pixel sheet stretched over four tiles is not that block,
     * it is a smear — no per-block faces, and the sides only where the eye is
     * on that side.
     *
     * <p><b>In rings, each coarser than the one inside it.</b> One group size
     * over the whole distance is wrong at both ends: fine enough to meet the
     * detailed terrain without a visible step is tens of thousands of groups
     * out at the horizon, and coarse enough to afford the horizon puts a
     * staircase of eight-tile steps right where the player can see what it
     * should have been. So each ring reaches {@link #RING_SPLIT} times as far
     * as the last and is drawn at {@link #groupFor} that distance — the same
     * trade Distant Horizons makes and for the same reason. The error stays
     * roughly one <em>angular</em> size all the way out, and so does the cost
     * per ring, which is what lets the horizon reach two thousand blocks for
     * about what it used to spend on a hundred and twenty.
     *
     * <p><b>Every ring overlaps the one inside it</b> rather than abutting it:
     * a box is drawn whenever any part of its group falls outside the inner
     * radius, so the boundary is covered twice and never missed. It has to be —
     * a group is square and the radius is round, so groups that straddle the
     * circle would otherwise leave a gap the width of a group, which is a
     * ring of bare sky between the terrain you are standing on and the terrain
     * on the horizon. What resolves the overlap is {@link #orderBias}: each
     * ring sorts strictly behind the ring inside it, and all of them behind the

     * three corners decide an affine map and the fourth lands wherever the
     * divide put it. Used over a whole face that is what a player sees as the
     * surface <em>bending</em> — the texture shears away from the geometry it
     * is painted on, worst on exactly the faces that run away from the eye,
     * which is most of the floor and every wall seen at an angle. Clipping it
     * to the face hides the overspill and turns the rest into a fold.
     *
     * <p><b>What is drawn instead.</b> The face is halved, in its own texture
     * coordinates, until every piece of it <em>is</em> nearly a parallelogram
     * on screen — until its {@linkplain #MAX_PATCH_DEFECT defect} is under a
     * couple of pixels — and an affine map over such a patch is the perspective
     * map, to within that. A face square-on to the eye is already a
     * parallelogram and is one patch, which is the common case and costs
     * exactly what one blit did before; a floor tile stretching away underfoot
     * is a handful. Each patch takes the slice of the sheet that belongs to it,
     * so the texture stays continuous across the joins.
     *
     * <p><b>Which edge is halved</b> is whichever is longer <em>on screen</em>,
     * not whichever is longer on the sheet. Splitting one axis over and over
     * looks like the answer — a floor recedes along one axis, so strips across
     * it ought to do — and it converges far too slowly to afford: the defect of
     * a strip falls in proportion to how many strips there are, so a tile
     * underfoot whose near edge is a hundred pixels wider than its far one
     * wants fifty of them. Halving the longer edge takes both axes down
     * together and gets to the same place in a dozen.
     *
     * <p>The map for a patch is the affine that fits its four projected corners
     * <em>least-squares</em> rather than the one pinned to three of them: the
     * residual is then a quarter of the defect at each corner instead of the
     * whole of it at one, and it is the same size on both sides of a join,
     * which is what {@link #blit} needs to be able to close them.
