/**
 * The engine's mini games — the small, complete games that sit beside the world
 * engine rather than inside a level.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the backend the launch screen's buttons are drawn from.</b>
 * Each entry names the game, the scene that opens it, and the texture key its
 * button art is looked up under ({@link #textureKey()}); a texture pack that
 * drops a sheet in at that key redresses the button without a line of code
 * changing, and the built-in art is generated from {@link #accent()} when no
 * pack supplies one. Adding a mini game here is what puts it on the launch
 * screen, in the pack's key list, and in the texture dialog — the alternative
 * was three names hard-coded in a menu and three pictures nobody could replace.
 *
 * <p>Not to be confused with {@link MiniGameConfig.Mode}, which is a rule set a
 * <em>level</em> plays under (capture the flag, escort). These are separate
 * games with their own scenes, their own lobbies and their own controls.
