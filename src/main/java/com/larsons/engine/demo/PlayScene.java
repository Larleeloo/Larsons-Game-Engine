/**
 * Gameplay scene that honours the active {@link GameProfile}: it only enables
 * the features the creator turned on — perspective, zoom + bounds, gravity,
 * HUD, grid, entity sizes, and (merged in from the Side-Scroller engine)
 * mobs, items + inventory, combat, block mining/placing, lighting, parallax,
 * particles, and sound — and exposes the same toggles live via a pause menu
 * (Esc), so features can be enabled/disabled both on launch and in-game.
 *
 * <p><b>Online play (requirement #3).</b> When the {@link GameContext} carries
 * a {@link NetSession}, this same scene becomes the multiplayer client: the
 * level comes from the server (and stays in sync as block edits are
 * broadcast), the local player is <em>predicted</em> with the identical
 * {@link PlayerPhysics} the server runs, remote players are interpolated, and
 * mobs/dropped items are rendered from server snapshots (the server is the
 * only simulation). Mining, placing, and attacks are requests the server
 * validates and applies.
 *
 * <p><b>Characters (requirement: character profiles).</b> A level offers the
 * roster its creator chose; the picker shown at its start decides who you
 * play as, and that profile's traits — speed, sprint, air jumps, jump height,
 * health/mana/stamina — ride on the simulated player state from there. Their
 * {@link Ultimate} charges with time and damage dealt and fires on [R].
 *
 * <p><b>Perspective (requirement #2).</b> The level's format decides how the
 * world is drawn <em>and</em> which axis is up in it — see
 * {@link com.larsons.engine.sim.PerspectiveSpace}. That is what the effects
 * here read: a burst on a plane spreads across the floor and rises off it
 * toward the viewer, and a shot with height on it draws above its own shadow,
 * rather than every effect replaying a side-scroller's screen-space "up".
 *
 * <p>The perspective is the level's and stays the level's for as long as it is
 * played. The three formats are not three views of one world — they differ in
 * which axis is up, in what a block means, and in how many layers of them the
 * geometry is written in — so there is nothing coherent for a mid-level switch
 * to show. Walking through a door into a level of another format is how a game
 * changes perspective.
 *
 * <p><b>Melee combat.</b> Whatever is in the player's hands brings a set of
 * moves with it ({@link com.larsons.engine.combat.MeleeAction}) — a swing, a
 * parry, a lunge, a dash, and a held guard — on timings that belong to that
 * object, so a dagger and a war hammer play completely differently out of the
 * same controls. The same machine runs for mobs and on the authoritative
 * server, and the object may bring its own art and its own voice for every one
 * of those moves (see {@link com.larsons.engine.combat.MeleeSprites} and
 * {@link com.larsons.engine.combat.MeleeSounds}).
 *
 * <p>Controls: WASD/arrows move — up is a direction (it swims, it climbs, it
 * walks north), never a jump — Space jumps in every perspective (a hop along
 * the elevation axis in top-down and isometric levels), +/- zoom (if enabled),
 * left-click mine/attack, right-click place, 1-5 + wheel hotbar, I inventory,
 * F eat, R ultimate, C hold to guard, V parry, X lunge, Z dash, Esc pause.
