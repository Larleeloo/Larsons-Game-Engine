/**
 * Every place the level-loader game makes a sound, and the file name a
 * {@link SoundPack} expects for it — the audio twin of
 * {@link com.larsons.engine.graphics.TextureKeys}.
 *
 * <p>A sound key names an <em>object</em> and an <em>action state</em>:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   player/jump            -&gt; player/jump.wav
 *   player/swim            -&gt; player/swim.wav
 *   character/rogue/hurt   -&gt; player/rogue_hurt.wav
 *   block/dirt/break       -&gt; blocks/dirt_break.wav
 *   block/water/splash     -&gt; liquids/water_splash.wav
 *   mob/slime/attack       -&gt; mobs/slime_attack.wav
 *   item/iron_sword/use    -&gt; items/iron_sword_use.wav
 *   projectile/meteor/fire -&gt; projectiles/meteor_fire.wav
 *   ultimate/meteor_volley/activate -&gt; ultimates/meteor_volley_activate.wav
 *   music/level            -&gt; music/level.mp3
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Keys fall back one segment at a time, exactly like texture keys, so
 * {@code mob/slime/attack} tries {@code mobs/slime_attack} and then
 * {@code mobs/slime}: one file gives a mob every sound it makes, and a
 * creator who wants a distinct death cry just adds another file.
 *
 * <p>{@link #all()} reads the <em>live</em> registries, so blocks, mobs,
 * items, decorations and characters made with the palette's "+ New …"
 * buttons appear in the catalogue — and in the generated
 * {@code SOUND_KEYS.txt} — alongside the built-ins, with the same action
 * states as everything else of their kind.
 *
 * <p>Every one of these defaults to <b>silence</b>. A handful of keys — the
 * ones the engine had synthesized effects for before sound assets existed —
 * keep a built-in voice as their fallback (see {@link SoundSynth}); the rest
 * make no sound at all until a WAV or MP3 with the right name is dropped
 * into the pack.
