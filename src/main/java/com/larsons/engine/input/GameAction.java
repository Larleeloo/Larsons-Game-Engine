/**
 * Everything a player can rebind, engine-wide.
 *
 * <p>Gameplay code never names a key: it asks {@link KeyBinds} whether an
 * action is down, and the controls menu decides what "down" means. Adding an
 * action here — with the keys it ships bound to — is all it takes for it to
 * appear in that menu, save with the rest, and be reassignable to any key or
 * mouse button.
 *
 * <p>Actions carry a {@link Category}, which is both how the controls menu is
 * grouped and the scope conflicts are reported in: the same button doing two
 * things in two different contexts is normal (the left mouse button attacks
 * while playing and paints while editing), while two actions in one context
 * fighting over a button is the mistake worth warning about.
