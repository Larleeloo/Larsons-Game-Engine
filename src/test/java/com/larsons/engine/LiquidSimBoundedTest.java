/**
 * SIM_PLAN S3: the liquid simulation now costs what the liquid costs, not what
 * the level costs — and it produces exactly the same water.
 *
 * <p><b>The bug was reported as an out-of-memory crash, which is the loudest
 * possible version of the p95 stall SIM_PLAN was written about.</b> Every pass
 * in {@code LiquidSim} walked the whole grid — presence, drain, grow, quench,
 * and the reachability BFS's own source hunt — and the BFS allocated an
 * {@code int[3]} per queue entry and an {@code int[width * height]} per liquid
 * family per tick. On a large dense level that exhausted a two-gigabyte heap:
 *
 * <pre>
 * java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
 *   at com.larsons.engine.world.LiquidSim.reachable(LiquidSim.java:262)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A pond in the corner of a big map cost exactly as much as a flooded one.
 * The work is now bounded to a box around each liquid family, grown by the
 * furthest one tick can carry it.
 *
 * <p><b>Two things have to be true, and they pull against each other.</b> The
 * cheap version must not be a <em>different</em> simulation — SIM_PLAN
 * invariant 1 is that the sim stays deterministic, because the server ticks it
 * and clients predict with it, and a change that makes one machine faster and
 * two machines disagree is not an optimisation. So the behavioural half of this
 * file pins what the water actually does, and the cost half pins that it no
 * longer scales with empty space.
