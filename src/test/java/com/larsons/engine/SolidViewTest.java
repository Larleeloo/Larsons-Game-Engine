/**
 * The first- and third-person views: {@link EyeCamera}, {@link SolidPainter}
 * and the {@link Viewpoint} cycle they are chosen through.
 *
 * <p><b>What is worth pinning here, and what is not.</b> Whether the picture
 * <em>looks</em> right is not something a test can say, and this does not
 * pretend to: what it pins is the handful of properties that are exactly
 * checkable and that everything visible rests on.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The divide.</b> A perspective camera is a parallel one plus a
 *       division by depth, and that division is the whole feature. If twice as
 *       far is not half as big, nothing else about the view is worth
 *       looking at.</li>
 *   <li><b>The near plane.</b> Geometry behind the eye projects to a finite
 *       point on the <em>wrong</em> side of the screen, so it must be cut
 *       rather than dropped or trusted.</li>
 *   <li><b>Face exposure.</b> A buried face is never drawn. This is what makes
 *       the sweep affordable at all, and it is invisible when it breaks — the
 *       picture is identical and the frame is ten times the cost.</li>
 *   <li><b>The crosshair's march.</b> What you are looking at has to be the
 *       block you are looking at, including which of its faces, because that
 *       is the difference between placing a block against a wall and inside
 *       it.</li>
 * </ul>
