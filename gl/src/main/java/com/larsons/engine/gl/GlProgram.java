/**
 * The one shader every draw goes through.
 *
 * <p><b>One program, because that is what makes the batch a batch.</b> A shape
 * is a quad sampling a 1×1 white texture; a sprite is a quad sampling an atlas
 * page; a glyph is a quad sampling the same atlas page. Multiply the sample by
 * the vertex colour and all three are the same instruction, which means a
 * label between two icons appends to whatever is already open and a panel
 * behind them does too. A second program for flat geometry would be marginally
 * faster per triangle and would flush the batch every time the frame alternated
 * between a shape and a sprite — which, in this engine's UI, is every other
 * operation.
 *
 * <p><b>Colours are straight alpha, not premultiplied.</b> The atlas pages are
 * {@code TYPE_INT_ARGB} and the engine's colours are {@code 0xAARRGGBB}, both
 * straight; multiplying a straight texel by a straight vertex colour gives a
 * straight result, and {@code SRC_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA} composites it the
 * way {@code AlphaComposite.SRC_OVER} does. Premultiplying would be the right
 * choice if anything here filtered texels — it is the arrangement that keeps
 * bilinear sampling from darkening edges — but everything samples
 * {@code GL_NEAREST}, because the Java2D backend renders with
 * {@code VALUE_INTERPOLATION_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR} and this one has to agree with
 * it pixel for pixel.

     * {@code zoom = 1.7} — the sizes a player actually plays at, since zoom is a
     * {@code double} driven by a held key. At that ratio some texel boundaries

     * the rasteriser interpolated across the quad. Those bits change when the
     * quad moves, even by a whole pixel, so the inside of every sprite fizzes as
     * the camera pans while its edges sit perfectly still.
     *
     * <p>Measured, at 2× over a wall of tiles crept a quarter-pixel at a time:
     * Java2D moved <b>0</b> pixels beyond the camera's own shift and GL moved
     * <b>28–169</b>, every one of them inside a tile and none within two pixels
     * of a tile's edge — which is what ruled out the rasteriser, the multisample
     * resolve and the batch, and left the sampler.
     *
     * <p>Java2D does not have this because it maps destination column to source
     * column with integer arithmetic anchored at the rectangle's own origin, so
     * translating the rectangle translates the answer exactly. This gets the
     * same determinism the way a shader can: nudge a fixed fraction of a texel
     * past the boundary before flooring, then sample that texel's centre.
     * Sampling the centre rather than the nudged coordinate is the half that
     * keeps it safe — the value handed to the sampler is always well inside the
     * texel it names, so no bias can push a sample into an atlas neighbour.
