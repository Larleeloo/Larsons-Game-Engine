/**
 * {@link DrawTarget} over OpenGL 3.3 core — the GPU backend.
 *
 * <p><b>This class is short for what it does, and that is the result of B1–B6
 * rather than a property of GL.</b> Every verb below is an append to one vertex
 * buffer against one shader, because the interface was sized by counting what
 * the engine really draws (B1), the painters and scenes were moved onto it
 * unchanged (B2, B3), the seam was sealed so nothing could drift back (B4), and
 * the art and the text were packed onto shared pages so consecutive draws name
 * the same texture (B5, B6). What is left here is a translation, which is what
 * the plan said this step would be if the six before it were done properly.
 *
 * <p><b>What breaks a batch, and what pointedly does not.</b> A texture change,
 * a clip, and the two stencil paths. Not alpha — it multiplies into the vertex
 * colour. Not a transform — it is applied on the CPU as vertices are appended.
 * Both are pushed and popped constantly by the entity and UI phases, and a
 * backend that flushed on either would report a merge ratio near one however
 * well the art was atlased.
 *
 * <p><b>Flat shapes sample a white texel on the sprite page</b>, not a texture
 * of their own — see {@code whitePixel} for why the difference is the whole
 * point rather than a detail. A rectangle, an icon and a label then name the
 * same texture, and a frame of label-box-label-box collapses into one batch.
 * B6 named five frames its own step could not move and left them as this
 * step's prediction to be judged on; the judgement is in
 * {@code RENDER_PLAN.md}.
 *
 * <p><b>Java2D appears here twice, both times for measurement, never to draw.</b>
 * A 1×1 scratch {@link Graphics2D} answers {@link #textWidth} and supplies the
 * {@link FontRenderContext} the glyph atlas rasterises against — because layout
 * must be bit-identical across backends or every UI in the game moves when the
 * renderer changes, which is B6's rule and it does not stop applying because
 * the backend did. And an unservable text run is baked to an image and drawn as
 * a quad, which is the GL equivalent of the fallback the Java2D path already
 * has. Neither is a seam: nothing outside this file can reach either one.
